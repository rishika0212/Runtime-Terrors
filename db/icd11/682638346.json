    "@value": "Breech presentation refers to a fetus that is lying with its bottom downwards. There are three different types of breech presentation: breech with extended legs (frank), fully flexed legs (complete), or footling (incomplete) with one or both thighs extended. Breech presentation is associated with an increased risk of intrapartum trauma or asphyxia, and caesarean section is a common mode of delivery to reduce birth-related complications."
