    "@value": "Female pattern hair loss differs from male pattern hair loss not only in being generally less pronounced than in men but also by the fact that the normal frontal hair line is usually preserved. A quarter of women will develop clinically detectable pattern hair loss by the age of 70. In the majority of cases it can be attributed to the effects of androgens."
