    "@value": "A disease endemic to the Argentine Pampas that is caused by an infection with Junín virus and that is characterised by haemorrhagic and neurological manifestations and high lethality (10-30%). The disease begins with a 6-14 day-lasting prodromic phase. Argentinian haemorrhagic fever presents with fever, myalgia, erythema, conjunctival injection, non-menstrual uterine bleeding, epistaxis, haematemesis, melena, haematuria, or shock. Around 20-30% of patients advance to a neurological and haemorrhagic phase. Survivors have a long convalescence period. Transmission occurs by inhalation, consumption, or direct contact with excretions and bodily fluids from infected rodents. Diagnosis occurs by identification of Junín virus from blood or mucosal secretions samples."
