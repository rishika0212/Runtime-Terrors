    "@value": "A condition affecting fetuses or neonates, caused by an infection with the gram-positive bacteria Listeria. This condition is characterised by respiratory distress and shock in the neonate, by stillbirth, or by abortion. Transmission is by vertical transmission. Confirmation is by identification of Listeria in the neonate and mother."

  "longDefinition": {
    "@language": "en",
    "@value": "Neonatal listeriosis is an infection caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, and is acquired either transplacentally, during delivery, or following birth. An infection transplacentally can lead to fetal dissemination with the formation of granulomas, for instance, in the lungs, brain, and skin. If amniotic fluid or vaginal secretions are swallowed, this can lead to a perinatal infection in the lungs and manifest as shock and respiratory distress in the first few days of life. Premature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal sepsis is common."
