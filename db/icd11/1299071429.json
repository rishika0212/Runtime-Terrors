    "@value": "An incomplete fracture not directly involving a vital pulp is often termed a greenstick fracture. This condition is very sensitive, yet the patient can specify only which side of the mouth is affected rather than the specific tooth. Usually, pain is not associated with complete fracture not involving vital pulp, unless the gingival border of the fractured segment is still held by periodontal tissue. \n\nFracture involving vital pulp always results in pulpal infection and severe pain.It has been proposed that the predominant causative factor of some cervical, wedge-shaped defects is a strong( heavy) eccentric occlusal force (shown as an associated wear facet resulting in microfractures or abfractures. Such microfractures occur as the cervical area of the tooth flexes under such loads."
