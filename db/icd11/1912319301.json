This disease may also present with chest pain, productive cough, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, hypoxia, and tachycardia. Transmission is by droplet transmission. Confirmation is by identification of adenovirus in a sputum sample."

    "@value": "Adenoviral is most frequently associated with upper respiratory tract syndromes, but can also cause pneumonia. Most adenovirus infections are self-limiting, although fatal infections can occur in immunocompromised hosts, neonates, and, occasionally, healthy children and adults. In children, adenoviruses cause approximately 10% of pneumonias.[1] The clinical characteristics of adenovirus pneumonia are similar to those of other pneumonias. In fatal cases there has been extensive pulmonary damage, with death occurring 2 to 3 weeks into the illness. Intravascular coagulopathy has also been a late feature of some cases, and a septic-shock picture has been described. Adenoviruses cause a particularly aggressive form of pneumonia in neonates, characterized by necrotizing bronchiolitis and alveolitis.[2]"
