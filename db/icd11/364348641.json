    "@value": "A congenital cardiovascular malformation in which there is dilation of one or more sinuses of Valsalva.\n\nAdditional information: the sinus of Valsalva is defined as that portion of the aortic root between the aortic root annulus and the sinotubular junction. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm most commonly originates from the right sinus, less commonly from the non-coronary sinus and rarely from the left sinus (<5%). The aneurysm may rupture into an adjacent chamber or site (right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle, pulmonary artery, pericardium) and in this case should be coded specifically (‘Ruptured aortic sinus of Valsalva aneurysm’). This is to be distinguished from aortic root dilation associated with connective tissue disorders and aortopathies."
