    "@value": "Sleep-related bruxism is characterised by repetitive, rhythmic jaw muscle contractions that occur during sleep. These contractions can take the form of repetitive phasic muscle contractions or isolated sustained jaw clenching (tonic contractions). These contractions during sleep produce tooth-grinding sounds. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep) or significant damage to the teeth."
