    "@value": "REM sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by repeated episodes of sleep related vocalization or complex motor behaviours that are either documented by polysomnography to occur during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep or are presumed to occur during REM sleep due to a clinical history of dream enactment. Polysomnographic recording (when performed) demonstrates REM sleep without atonia. The disorder may occur as an isolated, idiopathic form but is frequently associated with latent or manifest disease of the nervous system, especially alpha-synucleinopathies.\n\nNote: A provisional diagnosis may be established on clinical grounds but definitive diagnosis requires polysomnographic demonstration of REM sleep without atonia."
