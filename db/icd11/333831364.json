    "@value": "Within a few days of infection the mumps virus can attack the testicular glands leading to abrupt onset of fever ranging from 39 to 41 °C, severe testicular pain, scrotal swelling and erythema. Mumps induced orchitis typically presents 1-2 weeks after parotitis. The virus’ infiltration into the testicular glands can cause parenchymal inflammation, separation of seminiferous tubules and perivascular interstitial lymphocyte infiltration. Testicular atrophy can result from a rise in intratesticular pressure. Complications include oligospermia, azoospermia, and asthenospermia, which can contribute to subfertility. Infertility is more common in patients with bilateral mumps orchitis and is estimated to occur in approximately 13% of all patients. Sterility is rarely induced by mumps orchitis."
