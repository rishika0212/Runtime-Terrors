    "@value": "Acute hepatitis E is acute liver injury caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is single stranded RNA virus, 27-34nm in length, in the genus Hepevirus. HEV usually spreads by a water-borne infection or zoonotic infection (fresh meat consumption of pigs, boars, and deer). Transfusion-related transmission of HEV has been documented among immunodeficient persons but is rare. Acute HEV is diagnosed by positive serum IgA or IgM anti HEV in acute phase of hepatitis, although the presence of serum HEV RNA is the gold standard for the diagnosis. Acute hepatitis E is usually self-liming; fulminant type can occur, although rare."
