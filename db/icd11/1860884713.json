    "@value": "While children with imperforate or obviously mislocated anus are identified in the newborn period, some children with a very mild abnormality may escape identification until after the newborn period. This mild mislocation of the anus has been termed anterior ectopic anus. Anterior ectopic anus is different from imperforate anus with perineal fistula in that the anal opening is usually of normal size, and only mildly misplaced. Most of these children come to medical attention due to severe constipation."
