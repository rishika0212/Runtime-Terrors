    "@language": "en",
    "@value": "Cannabis-induced mood disorder is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from cannabis. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of Cannabis intoxication or Cannabis withdrawal. The amount and duration of cannabis use must be capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the cannabis use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the cannabis use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with cannabis use)."
