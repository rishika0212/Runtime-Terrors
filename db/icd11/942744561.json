    "@value": "Chronic blood loss is a possible cause in every case of iron-deficiency anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia may be caused by acute bleeding in gastrointestinal tract, uterus or genitourinary system, copious menstrual blood losses (menorrhagia) and multiple blood donations. In many tropical countries, infestations with hookworms lead to intestinal blood losses that in some individuals can be considerable. Iron deficiency may also be caused by several circumstances related to “chronic posthaemorrhagic anaemia”. A diagnosis of iron deficiency should always lead to a search for pathologic causes of blood loss (e.g. tumours in the gastrointestinal tract or uterus, especially if uterine bleedings have increased or changed in regularity)."
