    "@value": "Disorders of arousal from non-REM sleep are characterised by experiences or behaviours such as confusion, ambulation, terror, or extreme autonomic arousal that typically arise as a result of incomplete arousals from deep non-REM (N3) sleep. An exception is sleep-related eating disorder, which has been observed to arise during all stages of non-REM sleep. This group of disorders is also characterised by partial or complete amnesia for the event, inappropriate or absent responsiveness to efforts by others to intervene or redirect the person during the episode, and limited (e.g., a single visual scene) or no associated cognition or dream imagery. The experiences or behaviours are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning or significant risk of injury to the individual or to others (e.g., thrashing or striking out in response to efforts to restrain the individual)."
