If a mother is infected with tuberculosis, which is an airborne infectious disease, congenital tuberculosis may occur through bloodborne transmission to the placenta or genital tract. Symptoms are most often seen in the second or third week of life, and may include poor weight gain, lethargy, irritability, and cough. In addition to pulmonary involvement, transmission and infection in the bone, skin, kidney and brain may be seen."
