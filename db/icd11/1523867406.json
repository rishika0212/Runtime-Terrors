    "@value": "The non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophils is characterised by large numbers (inconsistently defined as >5% to >20%) of eosinophils on nasal smear. Patients usually have paroxysmal exacerbations of symptoms, including sneezing, profuse watery rhinorrhoea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, and occasional anosmia. It may precede the development of nasal polyposis and aspirin hypersensitivity. Patients with non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophils are at increased risk for the development of obstructive sleep apnoea."
