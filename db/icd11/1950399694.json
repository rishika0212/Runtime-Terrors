Unusual manifestations of disease include organ-specific (e.g. meningoencephalitis) or systemic inflammatory syndromes associated with viral recrudescence occurring after clinical recovery from acute disease. These manifestations may occur several months following infection. Additionally, this code may be used for unusual presentations of acute disease not included in the general description of Ebola disease."
