    "@value": "MOG antibody associated spectrum disorders are inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system with a predilection for optic nerve that include a subgroup of patients with bilateral optic neuritis (ON), longitudinally extensive (> 3 vertebral segments) myelitis (often recurrent) and rarely patients with an NMO like presentation. The clinical and immunopathological phenotype is under active investigation"

    "@value": "Patients with MOG antibodies tended to have a single or a lower number of attacks, whereas patients with AQP4 antibodies were more likely to be prototypical NMO patients, with relapsing disease characterised by severe optic neuritis or longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis attacks. The degree of recovery, measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and visual acuity, also indicates that patients with MOG antibodies tended to have a better recovery after an attack. However, is it important to emphasize some patients with MOG antibodies experience severe disability after optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis."
