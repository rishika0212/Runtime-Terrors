    "@value": "Sexual pain-penetration disorder is characterised by at least one of the following: 1) marked and persistent or recurrent difficulties with penetration, including due to involuntary tightening or tautness of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted penetration; 2) marked and persistent or recurrent vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during penetration; 3) marked and persistent or recurrent fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of penetration. The symptoms are recurrent during sexual interactions involving or potentially involving penetration, despite adequate sexual desire and stimulation, are not entirely attributable to a medical condition that adversely affects the pelvic area and results in genital and/or penetrative pain or to a mental disorder, are not entirely attributable to insufficient vaginal lubrication or post-menopausal/age-related changes, and are associated with clinically significant distress."
