    "@value": "Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) is characterised by the presence of circumscribed cutaneous plaques showing varying degrees of oedema, erythema, scaling, follicular plugging and atrophy. It most commonly presents as discoid plaques involving the face, ears and scalp but can be widely disseminated or may affect predominantly the extremities (chilblain LE) or subcutaneous fat (lupus panniculitis). It can cause marked disfigurement with prominent facial scarring and permanent hair loss. Most patients remain otherwise in good health but 5-10% may develop systemic lupus erythematosus. Photosensitivity is less apparent than in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus."
