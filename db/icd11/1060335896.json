Transmission only occurs in someone with chronic HBV infection (super-infection) or at the same time as acute hepatitis B (co-infection), and is by blood and body fluid contamination (parenteral spread), and sexual spread. Diagnosis is confirmed by serum IgM-anti-HDV. Clinical features, if they occur, are characterised by anorexia, nausea and fever, with jaundice in severe cases. Acute liver failure occurs in some cases, and a high proportion of cases develops chronic HDV infection."
