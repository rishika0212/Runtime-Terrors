    "@value": "Anisakiasis is a cosmopolitan parasitosis caused by the larvae of nematodes (roundworms) that infect marine mammals. Contamination is due to the ingestion of raw, undercooked, smoked, or home-marinated fish. The disease mainly occurs in Japan and in Northern Europe. Digestive pain and hypereosinophilia direct the diagnosis, which is confirmed by endoscopic, histological, and/or serologic methods. Preventive measures include cooking fish sufficiently or freezing it for at least 24 hrs at -20Â°C."
