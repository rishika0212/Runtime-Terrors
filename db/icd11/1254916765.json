    "@value": "Restless legs syndrome is a waking sensorimotor disorder characterised by a complaint of a strong, nearly irresistible urge to move the limbs. This urge to move is often but not always accompanied by other uncomfortable sensations felt deep inside the limbs. Although the legs are most prominently affected, a significant percentage of individuals with Restless legs syndrome describe some arm sensations. The symptoms of Restless legs syndrome are worse at rest, alleviated with movement, and predominant in the evening or night. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep). The vast majority of individuals with Restless legs syndrome also exhibit periodic limb movements during sleep. A separate diagnosis of Periodic limb movement disorder is not warranted in such cases because the limb movements during sleep are considered to be an expected part of Restless legs syndrome."
