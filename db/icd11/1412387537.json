Feeding disorders involve behavioural disturbances that are not related to body weight and shape concerns, such as eating of non-edible substances or voluntary regurgitation of foods. Eating disorders involve abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape concerns."
