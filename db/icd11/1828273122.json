    "@value": "A condition of the gastrointestinal system, caused by an infection with the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. This condition is characterised by acute and profuse diarrhoea (that may be haemorrhagic), fever, and abdominal cramps. Transmission is by the faecal-oral route from ingestion of contaminated food or water. Confirmation is by identification of the Escherichia coli in a faecal sample."

    "@value": "Escherichia coli infection caused by Enteroinvasive E coli (EIEC) strains which share virulence determinants with Shigella spp. The EIEC organisms invade the epithelial cells of the intestine, resulting in a mild form of dysentery, often mistaken for dysentery caused by Shigella species. The illness is characterized by the appearance of blood and mucus in the stools of infected individuals."
