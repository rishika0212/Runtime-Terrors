    "@value": "Volatile inhalant dependence is a disorder of regulation of volatile inhalant use arising from repeated or continuous use of volatile inhalants. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use volatile inhalants, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use volatile inhalants. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of volatile inhalants, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of volatile inhalants, or repeated use of volatile inhalants or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if volatile inhalant use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months."
