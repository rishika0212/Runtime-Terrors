    "@value": "Sleep related hypoxemia due to a medical condition is characterised by sustained declines in SpO2 (oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximeter) (≤ 88% in adults or ≤ 90% in children for ≥ 5 minutes) during sleep. The condition is attributable to a medical or neurological disorder. The presence of hypoxemia is not better explained by another sleep related breathing disorder (e.g., obstructive sleep apnoea). Although some amount of obstructive or central apnoea may be present, these disorders are not thought to be primarily responsible for the hypoxemia during sleep. Some patients with sleep related hypoxemia also exhibit hypoxemia during wakefulness. If the presence of hypercapnia has been established, a diagnosis of sleep-related hypoventilation should be made, rather than sleep-related hypoxemia.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnographic monitoring of oxygen saturation in arterial blood (SaO2) in the presence of a medical condition that is judged to be causing the declines in SaO2."
