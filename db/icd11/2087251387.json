    "@value": "Abrasion is abnormal tooth surface loss resulting from direct friction forces between the teeth and external objects or from frictional forces between contacting teeth components in the presence of an abrasive medium. Abrasion may occur from (1) improper brushing techniques, (2) habits such as holding a pipe stem by the teeth,(3) tobacco chewing, or (4) vigorous use of toothpicks between adjacent teeth. Toothbrush abrasion is the most common example and is usually seen as a sharp, V-shaped notch in the gingival portion of the facial aspect of a tooth."
