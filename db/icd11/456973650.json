    "@value": "A discrete dyskinetic area of the left ventricular wall with a broad neck after acute myocardial infarction. The wall of the true aneurysm is thinner than the rest of the left ventricle; it is usually composed of fibrous tissue and necrotic muscle, occasionally mixed with viable myocardium. In contrast, pseudoaneurysms are composed of organised hematoma and pericardium and lack any elements of the original myocardial wall."
