    "@value": "Psychotic disorder induced by unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from an unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance or withdrawal from the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance)."
