Factors to consider in addition to gestational age when determining the likelihood of favorable outcome with intensive care include, female sex, antenatal corticosteroids and singleton birth. Infants born at<28 weeks have a higher incidence of poor neurodevelopmental outcome, hearing loss, chronic lung disease and retinopathy of prematurity."
