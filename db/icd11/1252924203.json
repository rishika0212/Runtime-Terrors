    "@value": "Xerophthalmia or \"dry eye\" remains the most important cause of childhood blindness in many developing countries. Healed sequelae of prior corneal disease related to vitamin A deficiency include opacities or scars of varying density (nebula, macula, leukoma), weakening and outpouching of the remaining corneal layers (staphyloma and descemetocele) and, where loss of intraocular contents has occurred, phthisis bulbi, a scarred shrunken globe. Such end-stage lesions are not specific for xerophthalmia and may arise from numerous other conditions, notably trauma and infection."
