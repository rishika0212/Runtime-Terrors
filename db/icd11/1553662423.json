    "@value": "Treatment-emergent central sleep apnoea is characterised by persistence or emergence of recurrent, predominantly central sleep apnoea (more than five per hour) during effective treatment for obstructive apnoea (obstructive or mixed apnoea or hypopnea) with positive airway pressure. Central apnoeas must be the predominant finding (>50% of total respiratory events). The disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnea, or snoring. If the reduction or cessation of airflow due to absent or reduced respiratory effort is better explained by another central sleep apnoea disorder (e.g., Central sleep apnoea due to a medication or substance), that diagnosis along with a diagnosis of Obstructive sleep apnoea should be given, rather than a diagnosis of treatment-emergent central sleep apnoea.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."
