    "@value": "Unstable psoriasis is an inflammatory form of psoriasis which may be the precursor of erythrodermic or generalised pustular psoriasis. It is characterised by intense inflammation around the edges of existing plaques and/or the appearance of multiple small fresh inflammatory papules and plaques. Some patients may have a lifelong tendency to unstable psoriasis. It tends to be difficult to control without resort to systemic therapy."
