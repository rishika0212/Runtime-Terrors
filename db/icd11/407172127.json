It may be transmitted through sexual intercourse with an infected partner but may also be a presenting sign of diabetes mellitus. It presents as pink or red patches on the glans and inner surface of the prepuce rash. Satellite eroded pustules may be apparent. Itching, tenderness, discharge and preputial swelling may occur and in severe cases, it may be difficult to retract the foreskin.
