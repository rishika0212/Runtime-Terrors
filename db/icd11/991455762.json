HAV is usually spreads by faecal-oral transmission. The incubation period is 2 to 6 week after infection. Acute hepatitis A is diagnosed by positive serum IgM anti-HAV and usually shows a self-limiting course although fulminant course can occur rarely (the risk increases with age) and 5-10% of cases can be complicated by cholestasis persisting up to 6 weeks and 0.2% developing acute liver failure. It never progresses to chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis."
