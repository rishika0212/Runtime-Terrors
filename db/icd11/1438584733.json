    "@value": "Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues caused by a variety of pigmented fungi including Phialophora verrucosa, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fonsecaea compacta and Cladophialophora carrionii, which can be found in soil and wood. The infection usually follows trauma, such as a puncture from a splinter of wood and tends to affect exposed sites such as the feet and ankles. Chromoblastomycosis manifests initially as a warty papule which slowly enlarges to form a hypertrophic, warty plaque. Eventually, after months or many years, large hyperkeratotic masses may form, sometimes with secondary ulceration."
