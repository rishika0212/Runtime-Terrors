    "@language": "en",
    "@value": "Hazardous gambling and betting refers to a pattern of gambling or betting that appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences to the individual or to others around the individual. The increased risk may be from the frequency of gambling or betting, the amount of time spent on these activities, the context of gambling or betting, the neglect of other activities and priorities, risky behaviours associated with gambling or betting or its context, the adverse consequences of gambling or betting, or from the combination of these factors. The pattern of gambling or betting often persists in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the individual or to others. This category may be used when the pattern of gambling or betting warrants attention and advice from health professionals but does not meet the diagnostic requirements for Gambling Disorder."
