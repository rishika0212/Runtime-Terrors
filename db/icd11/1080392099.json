    "@value": "A disease of the pulmonary system, caused by an infection with the fungi Coccidioides. This disease is characterised by cough, myalgia, fatigue, chest pain, pneumonia, or pleural effusion. Transmission is commonly by inhalation of fungal spores. Confirmation is by direct examination or culture of Coccidioides in a sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or tissue sample."

    "@language": "en",
    "@value": "Forty per cent of coccidioidal infections result in symptomatic pulmonary disease that may be indistinguishable from a bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Radiographically these are usually focal alveolar infiltrates. Infection may be associated with the development of a rash, particularly erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme. Occasionally, there may be symmetric arthralgias or arthritis. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is not uncommon."
