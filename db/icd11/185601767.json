    "@value": "Cervicofacial actinomycosis is the commonest clinical form of actinomycosis, a sporadically occurring endogenous polymicrobial inflammatory process in which fermentative actinomycetes of the genera Actinomyces (especially A. israelii and A. gerencseriae), Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium act as the principal pathogens. The typical presentation is a slowly progressive development from painless tissue infiltration and induration of soft tissues of the face and neck to multiple abscesses and draining sinus tracts discharging pus. Actinomycosis is a major factor and indicator of poor prognosis in infected osteoradionecrosis of the jaws following radiation therapy for head and neck cancer."
