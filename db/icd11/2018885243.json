    "@value": "The diagnostic criteria for Post-polio progressive muscular atrophy (PPMA) are: a credible history of poliomyelitis with partial recovery of function, a minimum 10-year period of stabilization, and the subsequent development of progressive muscle weakness. Symptoms of weakness, atrophy, and fatigue of previously affected muscles may be seen. These symptoms may also be newly noted in muscles that were apparently unaffected by the poliomyelitis episode. Muscle cramps and fasciculations may accompany the new weakness."
