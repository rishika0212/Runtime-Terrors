    "@value": "Retrograde Ejaculation is a condition in which semen that is normally ejaculated via the urethra is redirected to the urinary bladder. Retrograde Ejaculation is typically accompanied by subjective orgasm, though the man may notice that release of semen is limited or absent. Retrograde Ejaculation most commonly occurs as a complication of transurethral prostatic resection, but may also be caused by other surgery of the pelvic area, nervous system dysfunction, or use of pharmacological agents. Confirmation is by identification of spermatozoa in a urine sample."
