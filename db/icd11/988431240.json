The intensity and duration of alcohol use must be known to be capable of producing memory impairment. The memory impairment may develop during or soon after alcohol intoxication or withdrawal, but its intensity and duration are substantially in excess of those normally associated with these conditions. The symptoms are not better accounted for by another disorder or medical condition, as might be the case if the amnestic symptoms preceded the onset of the alcohol use."
