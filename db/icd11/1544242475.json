    "@value": "In conjunctival xerosis the epithelium of the conjunctiva is transformed from the normal columnar to the stratified squamous type, with a resultant loss of goblet cells, formation of a granular cell layer, and keratinization of the surface. Clinically, these changes are expressed as marked dryness or unwettability, the affected area appearing roughened, with fine droplets or bubbles on the surface, rather than smooth and glistening. Conjunctival xerosis first appears in the temporal quadrant, as an isolated oval or triangular patch adjacent to the limbus in the interpalpebral fissure. It is almost always present in both eyes."
