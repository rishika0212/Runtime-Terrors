    "@value": "Hypersensitivity to herbal and alternative medical therapies refers to unpredictable conditions clinically resembling allergy that cause objectively reproducible symptoms or signs, initiated by exposure to herbal and other alternative medical therapies, such as homeopathy, cupping or acupuncture. Herbal and alternative medical therapies are not customarily regarded as drugs, but can trigger immune and non-immune mediated reactions, which occur in susceptible individuals. These reactions are triggered by doses and procedures usually tolerated by normal subjects."
