If diffuse areas of any size comprised predominantly or entirely of blastic cells are present in any case of follicular lymphoma, a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is also made. Lymphomas composed of centro cytes and centroblasts with an entirely diffuse pattern in the sampled tissue may be included in this category."
