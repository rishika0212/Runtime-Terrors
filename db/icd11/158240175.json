    "@value": "Sleep-related movement disorder due to a medication or substance is characterised by sleep-related movement abnormalities that are directly attributable to the effect of a medication or substance. Many substances may be associated with movement abnormalities that are evident in wake and sleep. To the extent that the movement abnormality is an expected complication of the substance(s) involved (e.g., tardive dyskinesia or akathisia associated with neuroleptic usage), this diagnosis should only be assigned if the sleep-related aspects of the movement abnormality or its sequelae are the focus of independent clinical attention."
