    "@value": "Developmental learning disorder with impairment in reading is characterised by significant and persistent difficulties in learning academic skills related to reading, such as word reading accuracy, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. The individual’s performance in reading is markedly below what would be expected for chronological age and level of intellectual functioning and results in significant impairment in the individual’s academic or occupational functioning. Developmental learning disorder with impairment in reading is not due to a disorder of intellectual development, sensory impairment (vision or hearing), neurological disorder, lack of availability of education, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or psychosocial adversity."
