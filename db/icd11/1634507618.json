    "@value": "Ulcerative mucositis typically appears in the non-keratinized surfaces of the oral cavity, for instance the inner surfaces of the cheeks and lips, the floor of the mouth and bottom surfaces of the tongue, and the soft palate. \nSome studies have reported a distribution of these lesions on keratinized surfaces such as the hard palate and upper surface of the tongue. If ulcerations are noted in these areas, cultures and/or biopsies should be taken from the lesions to rule out viral infections or other causes. Redness and/or ulcerations, ranging from a few millimetres to a few centimetres long, can appear. Bleeding from the ulcerations is common; however, bleeding often reflects a severe reduction in a patient's platelet count, a condition called thrombocytopenia."
