    "@value": "This condition groups several clinical consequences secondary to vitamin C deficiency with scurvy being the most severe presentation. The populations at risk of vitamin C deficiency are those for whom the fruit and vegetable supply is minimal. Epidemics of scurvy are associated with famine and war, when food supply is small and irregular. Children fed predominantly heat-treated (ultra-high-temperature or pasteurized) milk or unfortified formulas and not receiving fruits and fruit juices are at significant risk for symptomatic disease."
