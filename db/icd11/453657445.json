    "@value": "Central sleep apnoea due to a medical condition without Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSB) is characterised by recurrent, predominantly central apnoeas or central hypopneas (more than five per hour) that are attributed to a medical condition (and do not have the pattern of CSB). The majority of these patients have brainstem lesions of developmental, vascular, neoplastic, degenerative, demyelinating, or traumatic origin. The disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnea, or snoring.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography in the presence of a medical condition that is judged to be causing the symptoms."
