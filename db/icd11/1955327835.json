    "@value": "Placental insufficiency is defined as the inability of the placenta to deliver a sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, and therefore, is unable to sustain the growth of the developing baby until term. Placental insufficiency can result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), pre-eclampsia, abruption, or preterm labour and delivery. A small placenta is defined as a placenta that weighs less than the lower limit of normal for the gestational period. A low placental weight can be the result of a maternal or fetal conditions. Among maternal conditions belong those causing underperfusion of the placenta, such as pre-eclampsia or maternal hypertension. Among fetal conditions belong fetal malformations or chromosomal anomalies."
