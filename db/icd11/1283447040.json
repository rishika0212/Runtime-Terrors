Patients may present at birth with renal failure, defects in urine concentration, urinary sodium loss or acidosis. During the first year of life, the usual symptom is persistent anorexia with vomiting, and height-weight growth delay. This condition is often associated with progressive loss of kidney function and eventually kidney failure."
