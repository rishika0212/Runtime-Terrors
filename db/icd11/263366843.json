    "@value": "A disease caused by an infection with the parasitic worm Gnathostoma. This disease is characterised by painful, itchy swelling under the skin from movement of the parasite under the skin. This disease may also initially present with fever, lethargy, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhoea, and may infect other parts of the body (lungs, bladder, eyes, ears, nervous system). Transmission is commonly by ingestion of undercooked contaminated freshwater fish, eels, frogs, birds, or reptiles, or ingestion of contaminated water. Confirmation is commonly by detection of antibodies against Gnathostoma, identification of migratory skin lesions, eosinophilia, and history of potential exposure."
