In some cases, (for example, drowning and frostbite), injuries result from the sudden lack of essential agents such as oxygen or heat.\nInjuries may be categorized in a number of ways. However, for most analytical purposes and for identifying intervention opportunities, it is especially useful to categorize injuries according to whether or not they were deliberately inflicted and by whom. Commonly used categories are:\n\n- unintentional (i.e. accidental)\n- intentional (i.e. deliberate):\n- interpersonal (e.g. assault and homicide)\n- self-harm (e.g. abuse of drugs and alcohol, self-mutilation, suicide)\n- legal intervention (e.g. action by police or other law enforcement personnel)\n- war, civil insurrection and disturbances (e.g. demonstrations and riots)\n- undetermined intent\n\nRegarding the collection of events that cause injuries, a set of definitions apply. See section ‘Definition related to transport accidents’."
