Different classes of drugs, by virtue of immunological mechanisms, initiate specific inflammatory renal responses, which are manifested by different clinical patterns, such as drug-induced interstitial nephritis. The drug-induced kidney hypersensitivity can manifest alone or in combination with other drug-induced organ or system hypersensitivity disorders."
