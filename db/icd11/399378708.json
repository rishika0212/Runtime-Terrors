    "@value": "This category should be applied to forms of Stereotyped movement disorder in which stereotyped behaviours markedly interfere with normal activities, but do not result in self-inflicted bodily injury. Stereotyped movement disorder without self-injury is characterised by voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless (and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early developmental period, are not caused by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication (including withdrawal), and markedly interfere with normal activities. Stereotyped movements that are non-injurious can include body rocking, head rocking, finger-flicking mannerisms, and hand flapping."
