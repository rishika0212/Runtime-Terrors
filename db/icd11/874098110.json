    "@value": "Tachycardia secondary to accessory connection(s) (pathway[s]). Typical accessory pathways are extra nodal pathways that connect the myocardium of the atrium and the ventricle across the atrioventricular groove and are classified by location, type of conduction (decremental versus nondecremental), and whether they are capable of anterograde (manifest, demonstrating pre-excitation on standard ECG) or retrograde (concealed) conduction, or both. The Wolff-Parkinson-White \"Syndrome\" diagnosis is reserved for patients who have both preexcitation on ECG (manifest conduction) and tachyarrhythmias."
