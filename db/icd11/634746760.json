    "@value": "Cerebral edema is an excessive accumulation of water in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the brain. There is a break down of the tight endothelial junctions which make up the blood brain barrier. As water enters the white matter it moves along the fiber tracks. Tissue swelling follows within hours of severe brain contusion or bleeding and can be severe enough to cause compression and/or shift of the midline brain and ventricles with associated physiologic changes and serious morbidity or mortality."
