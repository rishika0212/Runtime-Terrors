    "@value": "Fetal diethylstilbestrol syndrome is characterised by a group of symptoms likely to occur in children and grandchildren of a woman who was treated while pregnant with diethylstilbestrol (DES). The drug is a synthetic nonsteroidal oestrogen, used in the US until 1971 and in Europe until 1978 to try and prevent miscarriage, premature delivery, and other pregnancy complications. It has been estimated that 25% of female fetuses exposed to DES in utero during the first trimester have subsequently developed genital tract anomalies including vaginal adenosis, cervical malformations, vaginal septae, uterine cavity anomalies, or fallopian tube anomalies causing subsequent fertility problems."
