    "@value": "Recurrent depressive disorder current episode, unspecified severity is diagnosed when the definitional requirements of a depressive episode have been met and there is a history of prior depressive episodes, but there is insufficient information to determine the severity of the current depressive episode. A depressive episode is characterised by a period of almost daily depressed mood or diminished interest in activities lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue. The symptoms are associated with at least some difficulty in continuing with ordinary work, social, or domestic activities."
