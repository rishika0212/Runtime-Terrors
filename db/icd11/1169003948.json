    "@value": "Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly expressive language is characterised by persistent difficulties in the acquisition, production, and use of language that arise during the developmental period, typically during early childhood, and cause significant limitations in the individual’s ability to communicate. The ability to produce and use spoken or signed language (i.e., expressive language) is markedly below the expected level given the individual’s age and level of intellectual functioning, but the ability to understand spoken or signed language (i.e., receptive language) is relatively intact."
