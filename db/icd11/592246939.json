    "@value": "Transient congenital hypothyroidism is defined as transient thyroid dysfunction with mildly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low thyroxine (FT4) levels which return to normal either very promptly and spontaneously, or after several months of thyroxine therapy. The disorder is due to a variety of causes including iodine deficiency or exposure to iodine-containing compounds, transplacental passage of blocking maternal antibodies, and dyshormonogenesis."
