    "@value": "Locked-in syndrome is a rare disease defined by the association of tetraplegia and palsy of most bulbar muscles without loss of consciousness. Vertical eye movements and blinking are the only means of communication. Locked-in syndrome is due to a pontine lesion, exceptionally to mesencephalic or bilateral lesions in capsula interna. The etiology is generally vascular secondary to basilar artery thrombosis."
