    "@value": "Cerebral cavernomas, still called cavernous angiomas, angioma cavernosum or cavernous hemangiomas, are vascular malformations in the brain that are asymptomatic or lead to seizures and/or cerebral haemorrhages. These are often found in an inheritable disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance."

  "longDefinition": {
    "@language": "en",
    "@value": "Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is composed of blood vessels devoid of muscular and elastic tissue that are lined with endothelial cells that do not have intervening tight junctions. CCMs can be sporadic or inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, in which multiple CCMs occur, and appear de novo.CCMs are prone to haemorrhage, focal neurological symptoms, and epileptic seizures. They can also occur withot symptoms. CCM have a characteristic MRI appearance."
