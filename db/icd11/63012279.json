    "@value": "A pattern of nicotine use that appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences to the user or to others to an extent that warrants attention and advice from health professionals. Most often nicotine is consumed in the form of tobacco, but there are also other forms of nicotine delivery (e.g., nicotine vapour). Hazardous nicotine use has not yet reached the level of having caused harm to physical or mental health of the user or others around the user. The pattern of nicotine use often persists in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the user or to others. This category is not intended to include the use of nicotine replacement therapies under medical supervision when these are used as part of attempts to stop or reduce smoking."
