    "@value": "A disease caused by determinants arising after birth, during the antenatal period or genetically inherited factors leading to premature haemolysis of red blood cells. This disease is characterised by low levels of red blood cells in the body due to abnormal breakdown of the cells. This disease may present with pallor, fatigue, or shortness of breath. Confirmation is by identification of low red blood cell count in a blood sample."
