    "@value": "A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent obsessions, compulsions, hoarding, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive behaviours, or other symptoms characteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a disorder or disease not classified under Mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by Delirium or by another Mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., repetitive ruminations in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention."
