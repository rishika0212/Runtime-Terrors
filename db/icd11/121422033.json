These cases use up a great deal more resources compared to non-CTO PCI cases both in terms of consumables as well as time. \nThe evidence supporting the benefit of treating CTO by dedicated PCI techniques is expanding and recognition of the benefits of PCI for CTO has been incorporated into mainstream guidelines - 2014 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization: The Task Force on Myocardial Revascularization of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS)"
