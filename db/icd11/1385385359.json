    "@value": "A pattern of cocaine use that appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences to the user or to others to an extent that warrants attention and advice from health professionals. The increased risk may be from the frequency of cocaine use, from the amount used on a given occasion, from risky behaviours associated with cocaine use or the context of use, from a harmful route of administration, or from a combination of these. The risk may be related to short-term effects of cocaine or to longer-term cumulative effects on physical or mental health or functioning. Hazardous use of cocaine has not yet reached the level of having caused harm to physical or mental health of the user or others around the user. The pattern of cocaine use often persists in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the user or to others."
