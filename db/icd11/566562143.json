    "@value": "A disease of the skin, caused by an infection with the fungi Lacazia loboi. This disease commonly presents with dermal nodules (either lenticular or in plaques), keloids, subcutaneous mycoses, or malignant tumours. Transmission is commonly by direct contact with contaminated water, soil, vegetation, or may be by direct contact with an infected dolphin. Confirmation is by identification of Lacazia loboi in a lesion exudate or tissue sample."

    "@value": "Lobomycosis is a chronic, subcutaneous infection caused by Lacazia loboi, a saprophytic fungus found in aquatic environments. Human infection most commonly develops after minor skin injury (e.g. from scratches or insect bites) to exposed parts of the body such as the face, ears, elbows, lower limbs and buttocks. Aquarium employees and farmers are at particular risk. Occupations such as gold-mining, fishing, and hunting also predispose to lobomycosis. It is characterized clinically by granulomatous subcutaneous nodules which may become verruceous."
