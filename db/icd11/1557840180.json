    "@value": "A condition caused by determinants arising after birth, in the antenatal period. This condition is characterised by defects in the alpha delta dense granules in platelets, leading to abnormalities in coagulation mechanisms. This condition may present with prolonged bleeding, epistaxis, menorrhagia, easy bruising, anaemia, fatigue or shortness of breath. Confirmation is by identification of low levels of alpha delta dense granules in a blood sample."
