    "@language": "en",
    "@value": "Synthetic cathinone-induced impulse control disorder is characterised by persistently repeated behaviours in which there is recurrent failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person, at least in the short-term, despite longer-term harm either to the individual or to others (e.g., fire setting or stealing without apparent motive, repetitive sexual behaviour, aggressive outbursts) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from synthetic cathinones. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of disturbances of impulse control that are characteristic of Synthetic cathinone intoxication or Synthetic cathinone withdrawal. The amount and duration of synthetic cathinone use must be capable of producing disturbances of impulse control. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Impulse control disorder, a Disorder due to addictive behaviours), as might be the case if the impulse control disturbances preceded the onset of the synthetic cathinone use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the synthetic cathinone use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with impulse control symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with synthetic cathinone use)."
