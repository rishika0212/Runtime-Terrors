To be considered negative psychotic symptoms, relevant symptoms should not be entirely attributable to antipsychotic drug treatment, a depressive disorder, or an under-stimulating environment, and should not be a direct consequence of a positive symptom (e.g., persecutory delusions causing a person to become socially isolated due to fear of harm). The rating should be made based on the severity of negative symptoms during the past week."
