    "@value": "Disorders due to use of synthetic cannabinoids are characterised by the pattern and consequences of synthetic cannabinoid use. Synthetic cannabinoids are synthesized diverse chemical compounds that are potent agonists for endogenous cannabinoid receptors. There are several hundred such compounds. The synthetic compound is typically sprayed onto a vehicle such as cannabis or tea leaves and then smoked. The effect of these compounds is distinctly different from smoking naturally cultivated cannabis in that the euphoric effects are typically accompanied or dominated by psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior). Synthetic Cannabinoid Intoxication may therefore present more frequently with psychotic symptoms in addition to the more typical effects of cannabis. Synthetic cannabinoids are also dependence-producing and Synthetic Cannabinoid Dependence and Synthetic Cannabinoid Withdrawal are recognized. Synthetic Cannabinoid-Induced Mental Disorders also occur; in particular Synthetic Cannabinoid-Induced Psychotic Disorder is recognized."
