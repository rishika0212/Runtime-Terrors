    "@value": "Bipolar type I disorder, current episode depressive, moderate, without psychotic symptoms is diagnosed when the definitional requirements for Bipolar type I disorder have been met and the current episode is depressive at a moderate level of severity and there are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode. A depressive episode is characterised by a period of depressed mood or diminished interest in activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue. In a moderate depressive episode, several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or a large number of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present overall. The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in multiple domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important domains)."
