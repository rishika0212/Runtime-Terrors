This disease is characterised by white, pink, fawn, brown, or often coalescing lesions that may be covered with thin furfuraceous scales.

    "@value": "A common mild chronic superficial skin infection by Malassezia yeasts. It is characterized by multiple discrete or confluent, finely scaling pale brown or depigmented macules, typically centred on the upper trunk. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation results in focal loss of pigment rather than tanning. It tends to be more severe in hot, humid tropical environments."
