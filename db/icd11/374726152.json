    "@value": "Bipolar type I disorder, current episode manic, without psychotic symptoms is diagnosed when the definitional requirements for Bipolar type I disorder are met, the current episode is manic, and there are no delusions or hallucinations present during the episode. A manic episode is an extreme mood state lasting at least one week unless shortened by a treatment intervention characterised by euphoria, irritability, or expansiveness, and by increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy, accompanied by other characteristic symptoms such as rapid or pressured speech, flight of ideas, increased self-esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, impulsive or reckless behaviour, and rapid changes among different mood states (i.e., mood lability). If the individual has experienced Manic or Mixed Episodes in the past, a duration of one week is not required in order to diagnose a current episode if all other diagnostic requirements are met."
