    "@value": "Pineoblastomas are a rare, malignant type of supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumour, found mainly in children (less than 10% of cases are reported in adults), located in the pineal region of the brain but that can metastasize along the neuroaxis. As they are the most aggressive of the pineal parenchymal tumours, they are usually associated with a poor prognosis."
