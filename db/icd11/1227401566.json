    "@value": "Cutis laxa is the term used for a group of inherited and acquired conditions in which abnormalities of elastic fibres result in loose, redundant, hypoelastic skin. Typically, the skin can easily be pulled away from underlying tissue and only slowly returns to its original position. Unlike some conditions in the differential diagnosis, cutis laxa is not characterised by spontaneous bruising or abnormal scarring. Redundant skin is often most noticeable on the neck, hands, and groin, but can also be seen on the face, creating a premature aging appearance."
