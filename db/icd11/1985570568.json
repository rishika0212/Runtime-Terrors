    "@value": "Oral lichenoid mucositis is a term describing clinicopathological features of the oral mucosa which represent a common end point in response to extrinsic agents such as drugs or contact allergens, or to presumed altered self-antigens as in lichen planus. Clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic\nwhite reticular striae to painful erythema and erosions. Idiopathic lichen planus cannot always be distinguished from lichenoid reactions to external agents and in such circumstances it is appropriate to label the changes observed as oral lichenoid mucositis until a more definitive diagnosis can be made."
