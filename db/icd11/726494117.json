    "@value": "Excoriation disorder is characterised by recurrent picking of oneâ€™s own skin leading to skin lesions, accompanied by unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour. The most commonly picked sites are the face, arms and hands, but many individuals pick from multiple body sites. Skin picking may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods. The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."
