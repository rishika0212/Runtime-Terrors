    "@value": "An eczema of unknown cause affecting principally the palms, soles and sides of the fingers and toes. It is commonly known as pompholyx and is characterised by eruptions of itchy, often multiloculated blisters, which tend to rupture and become secondarily infected. It occurs most commonly in adolescents and young adults. Its relationship to other forms of eczema and to allergic sensitisation, especially to nickel, remains to be adequately elucidated."
