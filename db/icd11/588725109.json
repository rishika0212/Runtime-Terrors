    "@value": "Sodium and chloride are usually found together in most foods as sodium chloride, also termed salt. For that reason, the effects of sodium and chloride deficiency are considered together. Deficiency can be caused by poor intake or increased losses (e.g., diuretics increase the urinary excretion of water, sodium, and chloride; in cystic fibrosis the sodium and chloride content of sweat is very high; gastrointestinal losses are associated with diarrhoeal diseases, emesis, ostomy output and other causes)."
