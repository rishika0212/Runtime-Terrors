    "@value": "Infantile atopic eczema is defined as atopic eczema present during the first year of life. It typically first manifests between the ages of 2 and 6 months: approximately 50% of people with atopic eczema first present in infancy. The face and non-flexural areas are commonly affected. The napkin area tends to be relatively spared. Involvement of the limb flexures, as is typical in childhood atopic eczema, is also often seen in infancy."
