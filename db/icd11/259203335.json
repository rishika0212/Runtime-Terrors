    "@value": "This category should be assigned when psychological and behavioural factors or symptoms are important contributing factors to the Sexual Dysfunction or Sexual Pain Disorder. Examples include low self-esteem, negative attitudes toward sexual activity, adverse past sexual experiences, and behavioural patterns such as poor sleep hygiene and overwork. Depressive, anxiety, or cognitive symptoms as well as other symptoms of Mental, Behavioural, or Neurodevelopmental Disorders may also interfere with sexual functioning. If the symptoms reach the level of constituting a diagnosable Mental and Behavioural Disorder and the Sexual Dysfunction or Sexual Pain Disorder is an independent focus of clinical attention, this category should be used and the appropriate Mental and Behavioural Disorder diagnosis should also be assigned. However, underlying or contributory Disorders Due to Substance Use should be noted using the category ‘Associated with use of psychoactive substance or medication’, rather than using this category."
