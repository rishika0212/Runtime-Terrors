Acute adverse effects of excess zinc include epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, headaches and gastrointestinal distress."

The adverse effect of excess zinc on copper metabolism (i.e., reduced copper status) was chosen as the critical effect on which to base an upper level for total daily intake of zinc from food, water and supplements in humans."
