    "@value": "Use this extension code to code the presence or absence of problematic emotional (e.g., anger, fear), cognitive (e.g., excessive worry, catastrophizing), behavioral (e.g., avoidance) or social factors (eg, work, relationships) that accompany a given health condition (e.g., chronic pain). The code for the presence of psychosocial factors is appropriate when there is positive evidence that psychological or social factors contribute to the cause, the maintenance or the exacerbation of the health condition, or associated disability, or when the health condition results in negative psychobehavioral consequences (eg, demoralisation, hopelessness, avoidance, withdrawal). Assigning this extension code does not require a judgement regarding aetiological contributions or causal priorities."
