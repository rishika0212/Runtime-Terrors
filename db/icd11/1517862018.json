    "@value": "Acute liver injury and inflammation caused by recent and short-term (less than 6 months) infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Transmission is by blood and body fluid contamination (parenteral spread) in most cases, and rarely by sexual spread or from mother to baby at the time of birth (vertical transmission). Diagnosis is confirmed by presence of recent acquisition of anti-HCV with presence of HCV RNA in serum. Clinical features occur in a minority of cases and are characterised by anorexia, nausea and fever, rarely with jaundice. A high proportion of cases (>70%) develop chronic HCV infection, with liver disease of varying severity."

    "@value": "Acute hepatitis C is acute liver injury caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a single stranded RNA virus belonging to the flavivirus family. This disease is transmitted parenterally (direct transfusion of blood and blood products, accidental or deliberated needle puncture including intravenous drug abuse, tattooing, acupuncture, and ear piercing) or by sexual contact. The majority of patients with acute hepatitis C are asymptomatic and about 70% develop chronic HCV infection, depending on age (lower in children) and severity of acute hepatitis (lower if jaundice develops)."
