    "@value": "A disease caused by a genetically inherited X-linked recessive trait leading to a defective gene located on the X chromosome. This disease is characterised by low levels of the protein factor IX in the body leading to increased haemorrhaging and bruising due to clotting abnormalities. Confirmation is by identification of recessive trait by genetic testing."
