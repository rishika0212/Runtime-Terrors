    "@value": "Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a clinically aggressive tumour derived from the precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs, also called professional type I interferon–producing cells or plasmacytoid monocytes), with a high frequency of cutaneous and bone marrow involvement and leukaemic dissemination.\n\nThere are currently no clues to the etiology of BPDCN, but its association with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in some cases may suggest a related pathogenesis. Gene expression profiling studies have revealed that the neoplastic cells show a gene expression signature similar to that of resting normal PDCs and closer to that of myeloid than of lymphoid precursors."
