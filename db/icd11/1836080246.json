    "@value": "A lack of vitamin A can affect iron metabolism when deficiencies of both nutrients coexist and particularly in environments that favour frequent infections. Maximum haemoglobin response occurs when iron and vitamin A deficiencies are corrected together. Vitamin A deficiency appears to influence the availability of storage iron for use by haematopoietic tissue. However, additional research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of the apparent interaction."
