    "@value": "Sometimes the blood content of monozygotic twins differs considerably, which can occur when anastomoses exist. One twin loses blood through shunts, while the other gains a large quantity of blood. Therefore, following the delivery of one twin, the other may bleed through these anastomoses if the umbilical cord of the delivered twin is not immediately clamped."
