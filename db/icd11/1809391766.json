    "@value": "Iron deficiency is probably the most common nutritional deficiency disorder in the world. Iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy increases perinatal risks for mothers and neonates; and increases overall infant mortality. Severe anaemia is a major risk factor associated with greatly increased morbidity and mortality for young children and pregnant women. Prompt recognition of the condition, treatment and clinical follow-up of individuals are crucial in avoiding complications such as high-output heart failure. Maternal iron deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of iron deficiency in the infant. In less developed countries, the prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy is higher than in developed countries, and iron supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial."
