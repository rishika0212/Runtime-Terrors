    "@value": "Periodic limb movement disorder is characterised by periodic episodes of repetitive (> 5/hour in children or > 15/hour in adults), highly stereotyped limb movements that occur during sleep, in conjunction with significant difficulties with sleep initiation or maintenance or fatigue that cannot be accounted for by another primary sleep disorder or other etiology. Specifically, when periodic limb movements are associated with Restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy or REM sleep behaviour disorder, a separate diagnosis of Periodic limb movement disorder is not warranted because the limb movements during sleep are considered an expected part of these disorders. Periodic limb movements occur most frequently in the lower extremities but may be seen in the arms as well. They may be associated with recurrent arousal from sleep, which gives rise to sleep disruption. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."
