    "@value": "Voyeuristic disorder is characterised by a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—that involves observing an unsuspecting individual who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity. In addition, in order for Voyeuristic Disorder to be diagnosed, the individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. Voyeuristic Disorder specifically excludes consensual voyeuristic behaviours that occur with the consent of the person or persons being observed."
