    "@value": "An inflammatory dermatitis of childhood which develops in a minority of children with HTLV‐1 infection, acquired usually via breast milk from an infected mother. Although the disease may clear spontaneously in adolescence, there is a high risk of development of Human T-cell lymphotropic virus-associated myelopathy (tropical spastic paraparesis) in later life. The onset is most frequent between the ages of 2 and 3, but it can manifest from as early as a few months of age to late childhood. Sites of predilection include the scalp, ears, eyelids, nostrils, neck, axillae and groin: erosions and crusting are commonly seen."
