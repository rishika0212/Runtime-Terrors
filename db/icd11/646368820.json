    "@value": "Talaromycosis is an infection due to Talaromyces marneffei, an ubiquitous saprophyte of soil and decomposing organic matter. This dimorphic fungus, formerly known as Penicillium marneffei, is endemic to Southeast Asia and the southern part of China. Once considered rare, its occurrence has increased due to AIDS. It is now the third most common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals. The most common symptoms are fever, skin lesions, anaemia, generalised lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly."
