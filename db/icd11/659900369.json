The pattern of episodic synthetic cathinone use is evident over a period of at least 12 months. Harm to health of the individual occurs due to one or more of the following: (1) behaviour related to intoxication; (2) direct or secondary toxic effects on body organs and systems; or (3) a harmful route of administration. Harm to health of others includes any form of physical harm, including trauma, or mental disorder that is directly attributable to behaviour related to synthetic cathinone intoxication on the part of the person to whom the diagnosis of Harmful pattern of use of synthetic cathinones applies."
