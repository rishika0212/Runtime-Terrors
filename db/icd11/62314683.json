    "@value": "Anxiety disorder induced by unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance is characterised by anxiety symptoms (e.g., apprehension or worry, fear, physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from an unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear-related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance or withdrawal from the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with the use of the unknown or unspecified psychoactive substance)."
