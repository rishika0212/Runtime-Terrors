    "@value": "Narcolepsy is a disorder characterised by daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep occurring for at least several months, accompanied by abnormal manifestations of REM sleep. Multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) demonstrates a mean sleep latency of <8 minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMP’s), or one or more SOREMP’s on MSLT and a SOREMP on the preceding overnight polysomnography (PSG). Nighttime sleep is often disturbed, and brief daytime naps are typically refreshing."
