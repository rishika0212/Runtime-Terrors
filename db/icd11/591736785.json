    "@value": "Anti-GBM mediated glomerulonephritis is an aggressive focal and segmental proliferative glomerular disease characterised by linear staining of the glomerular basement membrane for immunoglobulins, particularly IgG and IgM. Crescentic change is often associated and circulating anti-bodies to glomerular basement membrane are found in active disease. The renal syndrome is often acute nephritis with rapid renal functional decline (rapidly progressive nephritis) and if associated with respiratory involvement (haemoptysis, respiratory failure) the couple is termed “Goodpasture's syndrome”."
