The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., adjustment disorder or anxiety symptoms in response to being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness). These categories should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the psychological and behavioural symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention."
