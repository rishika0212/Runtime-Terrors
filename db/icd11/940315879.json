    "@value": "Delayed pressure urticaria differs from other forms of physical urticaria in that the appearance of weals is delayed for several hours following the provoking stimulus. It is commonly associated with chronic spontaneous urticaria but tends to respond poorly to antihistamine therapy. The palms and soles, the waist, and the buttocks and thighs are commonly affected areas. Wealing can be induced by a variety of stimuli, including standing, walking, wearing of tight clothes, or sitting on a hard surface."
