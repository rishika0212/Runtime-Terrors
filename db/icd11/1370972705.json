Typical microbes in the gastrointestinal tract include Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and less frequently, Clostridium difficile. Besides these classic pathogens, there is a growing list of other alleged candidates, such as arthritis developing after vaccination and exposure to environmental factors, such as silica."
