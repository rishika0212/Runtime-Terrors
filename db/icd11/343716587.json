    "@value": "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is an acute illness, usually of preterm infants, due to pulmonary surfactant deficiency, developing within 4-6 hours of birth, and is characterised by respiratory distress (tachypnoea, intercostal and sternal retractions, expiratory grunt, and cyanosis) with abnormal chest radiograph showing diffuse reticulogranular densities and air bronchograms, evidence of reduced lung compliance and functional residual capacity, evidence of abnormal gas exchange (hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, cyanosis) of sufficient severity to require oxygen and/or continuous or intermittent positive pressure ventilatory support for more than 24 hours."
