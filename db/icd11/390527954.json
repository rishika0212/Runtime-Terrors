    "@value": "Cryptococcosis is an infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. The organism infects the body through the lungs. Once inhaled, infection may be asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously, or present as pneumonia, with subsequent haematogenous dissemination to other organs. Disseminated infection is more common in immunocompromised persons, and may occur following years of latent infection. The central nervous system is the most common site of disease after the lungs."
