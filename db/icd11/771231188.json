    "@value": "Developmental learning disorder with impairment in mathematics is characterised by significant and persistent difficulties in learning academic skills related to mathematics or arithmetic, such as number sense, memorization of number facts, accurate calculation, fluent calculation, and accurate mathematic reasoning. The individual’s performance in mathematics or arithmetic is markedly below what would be expected for chronological or developmental age and level of intellectual functioning and results in significant impairment in the individual’s academic or occupational functioning. Developmental learning disorder with impairment in mathematics is not due to a disorder of intellectual development, sensory impairment (vision or hearing), a neurological disorder, lack of availability of education, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or psychosocial adversity."
