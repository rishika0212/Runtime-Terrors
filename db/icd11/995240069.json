The pain occurs on at least 50% of the days during at least three months. The duration of pain per day is at least 2 hours. Relevant non-vascular intracranial disorders include increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, low cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory intracranial disease, intracranial neoplasms, intrathecal injection, epileptic seizure, Chiari malformation type I, and other non-vascular intracranial disorders. Diagnostic Criteria Conditions A to D are fulfilled: A. Headache or orofacial pain for >2 hours on â‰¥15 days per month for longer than 3 months. B. Non-vascular intracranial disorder scientifically documented to be able to cause headache or orofacial pain has been diagnosed. C. Evidence of causation demonstrated by at least two of the following: C.1 Headache or orofacial pain has developed in temporal relation to the onset of the non-vascular intracranial disorder C.2 One or both of the following is fulfilled: a) Headache or orofacial pain has significantly worsened in parallel with worsening of the non-vascular intracranial disorder. b) Headache or orofacial pain has significantly improved in parallel with improvement of the non-vascular intracranial disorder C.3. Headache or orofacial pain has characteristics typical for the non-vascular intracranial ^ disorder C.4. Other evidence exists of causation D. The pain is not better accounted for by another diagnosis."
