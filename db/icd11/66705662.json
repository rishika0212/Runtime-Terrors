    "@value": "A condition caused by failure of the spinal cord to correctly develop during the antenatal period. This condition is characterised by tethering of the spinal cord to the spinal canal. This condition may present with lower back skin appendages, radicular pain, weakness, asymmetric hyporeflexia, spasticity, sensory changes, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or motor dysfunction. Confirmation is through observation of a tethered spinal cord by imaging."
