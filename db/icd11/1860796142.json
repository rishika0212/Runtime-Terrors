    "@value": "Eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells syndrome) is characterised by a distinctive clinical picture resembling cellulitis, and a typical histology with tissue eosinophilia, oedema and ‘flame’ figures (clusters of eosinophils and histiocytes around a core of collagen and eosinophilic debris). It can affect either sex, usually in adult life. Any site may be involved, with single or multiple lesions, and recurrences are common. Initially, the lesions are itchy erythematous plaques with features resembling both urticaria and cellulitis but bullous and nodular forms have also been described. It may arise spontaneously but a number of drugs and infections have been implicated."
