    "@value": "Rubella was a common childhood viral infection until the advent of mass immunization programmes. It is characterised by a short-lived maculopapular exanthem, lymphadenopathy and mild fever: the majority of infections are not associated with significant morbidity. Transmission is by inhalation of infected respiratory secretions or by direct contact. Confirmation is by identification of rubella virus in nasal swab, throat swab or blood samples, or by detection of rubella virus specific IgM antibodies. Its public health importance lies in its potential to cause devastating harm to the fetus of an infected mother (congenital rubella syndrome)."
