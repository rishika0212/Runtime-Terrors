    "@value": "Psoriasis is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder characterised by abnormal epidermal keratinization and hyperproliferation. It has a strong genetic component and affects some 2% of the populations of many regions of the world. Up to 10-20% of patients with psoriasis also experience an inflammatory polyarthritis (psoriatic arthritis). Although many people with psoriasis have limited disease, both psoriasis and its associated arthritis often cause major functional and psychosocial disability. The more severe forms of psoriasis are frequently associated with the metabolic syndrome and, as a result, a reduced life expectancy."
