This disease is characterised by acute inflammation of the bronchi leading to cough, sputum production, wheezing, or shortness of breath. Transmission is by inhalation of infected respiratory secretions, direct contact, or through fomites. Confirmation is by identification of the parainfluenza virus in respiratory secretions, detection of a significant rise in parainfluenza specific IgG antibodies in paired serum, or detection of parainfluenza specific IgM antibodies in a single serum sample."
