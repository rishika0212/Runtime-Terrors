    "@value": "Other specified psychoactive substance dependence is a disorder of regulation of use of a specified substance arising from repeated or continuous use of the specified substance. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use the specified substance, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use the specified substance. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of the specified substance, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of the specified substance, or repeated use of the specified substance or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if use of the specified substance is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months."
