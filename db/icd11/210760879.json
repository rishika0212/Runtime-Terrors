    "@value": "An increasingly reported fulminant fungal infection caused by Emmonsia and Emmonsia-like fungal species. It is seen in the context of profound immunosuppression, especially from HIV infection. This is in contrast with pulmonary adiaspiromycosis, which is also caused by Emmonsia species but typically affects immunocompetent individuals. Its clinical presentation is similar to those of histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. Skin and lung involvement is characteristic but the CNS and blood may also be affected."
