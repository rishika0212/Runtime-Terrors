    "@value": "Fetal valproate spectrum disorder (FVSD) and Fetal valproate syndrome (FVS) describe the range of signs and symptoms which occur as a consequence of exposure to sodium valproate or valproic acid in the womb. A wide range of physical anomalies occur at increased frequency, including spina bifida, major and minor limb abnormalities, oral clefting, cardiac defects, hypospadias, and joint laxity. A characteristic pattern of facial dysmorphism is frequently present, especially notable in early childhood. Neurodevelopmental problems including reduced IQ, poorer language and motor development, increased rates of autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are observed in up to 40% of those exposed. Vision problems such as myopia and astigmatism are also common. Risks are dose dependent and the impact on the brain may be seen at lower doses than those required for physical development alterations."
