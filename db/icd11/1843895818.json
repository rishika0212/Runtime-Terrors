Such specific manifestations may be a reason for treatment or encounter, with or without identifying or addressing the underlying condition.  \nCategories in this chapter include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, could be designated 'not otherwise specified', 'unknown aetiology' or 'transient'.\n\nThe conditions and signs or symptoms included in this chapter consist of:\n\n  - cases for which no more specific diagnosis can be made even after all the facts bearing on the case have been investigated\n  - signs or symptoms existing at the time of initial encounter that proved to be transient and whose causes could not be determined;\n  - provisional diagnoses in a patient who failed to return for further investigation or care;\n  - cases referred elsewhere for investigation or treatment before the diagnosis was made;\n  - cases in which a more precise diagnosis was not available for any other reason; \n  - certain symptoms, for which supplementary information is provided, that represent important problems in medical care in their own right.\n\nThese categories should be used in conjunction with a code from another chapter that identifies the underlying condition."
