    "@value": "Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis of unknown aetiology. It affects both women and men of all ages. It is characterised by the development of white, smooth, atrophic plaques on vulval and perianal skin in females and on the prepuce and glans penis in males. It often results in scar formation leading to a narrow introitus or phimosis with impairment of urinary and sexual function. The risk of anogenital squamous cell carcinoma is slightly increased. Less commonly other sites of the skin are affected, either independently or in conjunction with anogenital involvement."
