    "@value": "Clinically, the cornea develops classical xerosis, a hazy, lustreless, dry appearance, first apparent near the inferior limbus. Many children have characteristic superficial punctate lesions of the inferior-nasal aspects of their cornea that stain brightly with fluorescein. Early in the disease they are visible only through a slit-lamp examination. With more severe disease the punctate lesions become more numerous and spread upwards over the central cornea, and the corneal stroma becomes oedematous. Thick, keratinized plaques resembling Bitot's spot may form on the corneal surface. These are often densest in the interpalpebral zone. With treatment, these corneal plaques peel off, sometimes leaving superficial erosion which quickly heals. Corneal xerosis responds within 2-5 days to vitamin A therapy, the cornea regaining its normal appearance in 1-2 weeks."
