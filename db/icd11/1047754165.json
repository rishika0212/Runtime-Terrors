    "@value": "Cancer of the breast is one of the most common human neoplasms, accounting for approximately one quarter of all cancers in females. It is associated with the Western lifestyle, and incidence rates are, therefore, highest in countries with advanced economies. Additional risk factors include early menarche and late childbirth. Breast cancer is further characterized by a marked genetic susceptibility. Early detection and\nadvances in treatment have begun to reduce mortality rates in several countries. Through the use of cDNA expression profiles, it may become possible to predict clinical outcome in individual patients.\nThe typing of invasive breast cancer and its histological variants is well established."
