    "@value": "Short-term insomnia is characterised by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep of less than 3 months duration that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep and results in general sleep dissatisfaction and some form of daytime impairment. Daytime symptoms typically include fatigue, depressed mood or irritability, general malaise, and cognitive impairment. Individuals who report sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder. If the insomnia is due to another sleep-wake disorder, a mental disorder, another medical condition, or a substance or medication, short-term insomnia should only be diagnosed if the insomnia is an independent focus of clinical attention."
