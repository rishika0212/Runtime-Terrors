    "@value": "Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with delusions is characterised by the presence of delusions that are judged to be the direct consequence of alcohol use. Neither hallucinations nor other psychotic symptoms are present. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during hypnogogic or hypnopompic states, are not better accounted for by another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., schizophrenia), and are not due to another disorder or disease classified elsewhere (e.g., epilepsies with visual symptoms)."
