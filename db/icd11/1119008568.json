    "@value": "Olfactory Reference Disorder is characterised by persistent preoccupation with the belief that one is emitting a perceived foul or offensive body odour or breath that is either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others. Individuals experience excessive self-consciousness about the perceived odour, often with ideas of reference (i.e., the conviction that people are taking notice, judging, or talking about the odour). In response to their preoccupation, individuals engage in repetitive and excessive behaviours such as repeatedly checking for body odour or checking the perceived source of the smell, or repeatedly seeking reassurance, excessive attempts to camouflage, alter, or prevent the perceived odour, or marked avoidance of social situations or triggers that increase distress about the perceived foul or offensive odour. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."
