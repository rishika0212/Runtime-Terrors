    "@value": "A disease of the tonsils, caused by an infection with the gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes (Streptococcus group A). This disease is characterised by a sore throat, fever, tonsillar exudates, or cervical adenopathy. This disease may also present with odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, dry tongue, erythematous, enlarged tonsils, or yellowish white spots on the tonsils. Transmission is commonly by inhalation of infected respiratory secretions or indirect contact. Confirmation is by identification of Streptococcus group A from a throat swab."

    "@value": "This is a type of pharyngitis caused by a group A streptococcal infection.Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis presents with abrupt onset of sore throat, tonsillar exudate, tender cervical adenopathy, and fever. The public health importance of this infection lies not only in its frequency but also on the fact that it is a precursor of two serious sequelae, acute rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Acute streptococcal tonsillitis is a disease of childhood, with a peak incidence at about 5 to 6 years of age, but can occur in children younger than 3 years and in adults older than 50 years. Outbreaks may arise in epidemic forms in institutional settings such as recruit camps and daycare facilities. Acute tonsillitis manifests as a dry throat, malaise, fever, fullness of the throat, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, headache, limb and back pain, cervical adenopathy, and shivering. Examination reveals a dry tongue, erythematous, enlarged tonsils, and yellowish white spots on the tonsils. In severe cases, a tonsillar or pharyngeal membrane or purulent exudate may exist along with jugulodigastric lymph node enlargement."
