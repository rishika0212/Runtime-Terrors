    "@value": "Central sleep apnoea with Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterised by recurrent, predominantly central apnoeas or central hypopneas (more than five per hour) alternating with a respiratory phase exhibiting a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of flow (or tidal volume). The longer cycle length (> 40 seconds) distinguishes central sleep apnoea with Cheyne-Stokes breathing from other central sleep apnoea types. The vast majority of patients with Central sleep apnoea with Cheyne-Stokes breathing have either systolic or diastolic heart failure. Patients with Central sleep apnoea with Cheyne-Stokes breathing have normal or low daytime arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The disturbance is typically associated with atrial fibrillation/flutter, congestive heart failure, or a neurological disorder and is sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnoea, or snoring.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."
