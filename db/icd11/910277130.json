    "@value": "An inflammation of the pericardium that can produce chest pain, which occurs as early as the first day and as late as 6 weeks after acute myocardial infarction. The pain of pericarditis radiates to either trapezius ridge. Transmural myocardial infarction is responsible for local pericardial inflammation. Transient pericardial friction rubs are relatively common in patients with transmural infarction within the first 48 hours. An acute fibrinous pericarditis occurs commonly after transmural infarction, whereas the risk of haemorrhagic pericarditis is increased by anticoagulation."
