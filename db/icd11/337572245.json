    "@value": "An atrial arrhythmia in which there is intra-atrial reentry or circus movement around a fixed or functional central obstacle. The central obstacle may consist of normal (e.g. valves) or abnormal (e.g. scar) structures.\n\nThis form of SVT originates in the atrium; conduction to the ventricles is not necessary for the tachycardia to continue. An organised atrial rhythm with a rate typically between 250 and 350 bpm, including tachycardias using a variety of reentry circuits that often occupy large areas of the atrium (\"macro-reentrant\"). Here the arrhythmia involves the cavotricuspid isthmus."
