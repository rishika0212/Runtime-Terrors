    "@value": "Dilated cardiomyopathy due to a congenital anomaly of one or more coronary arteries, such as anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), coronary ostial stenosis or atresia, right ventricular dependent coronary circulation in pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum. It is a form of ischaemic cardiomyopathy causing systolic ventricular dysfunction that relates to a spectrum of perfusion contraction matching and mismatching, including myocardial infarction, stunning, hibernation and scarring."
