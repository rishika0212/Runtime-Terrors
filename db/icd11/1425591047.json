    "@value": "Myasthenia gravis is the most common autoimmune disease affecting the neuromuscular junction and is characterised by painless fatigable muscle weakness. It is caused by autoantibodies against neuromuscular junction proteins, either the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or the muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Mutations in neuromuscular junction proteins cause congenital myasthenic syndromes. Other antibodies mediated conditions affecting the neuromuscular junction, including Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome and neuromyotonia."
