    "@value": "Palatal myoclonus is usually a rhythmic, continuous movement of the muscles of the middle ear or palate, but can also include muscle of the eye, tongue, neck and diaphragm. The movement may be present in sleep or with distraction with a frequency of 1.5 to 3 Hz. Essential palatal myoclonus is more likely to have an associated rhythmic clicking noise compared to symptomatic palatal myoclonus."
