    "@value": "A provisional diagnosis for a chronic skin disorder of unknown or uncertain nature consisting of multiple circular or ring-shaped patches and plaques. Although infection due to dermatophyte infection (tinea or ringworm) can produce this pattern, many other skin disorders may have a discoid or annular configuration: these are frequently misdiagnosed as tinea. Common examples include atopic eczema, nummular dermatitis and psoriasis."
