    "@value": "Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a persistent and severe form of ocular allergy that affects children and young adults, usually in warm climates. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis typically appears in boys between the ages of 4–12 years. The typical symptoms are intense itching, tearing, and photophobia. Disease exacerbation can be triggered either by allergen re-exposure or by nonspecific stimuli such as sunlight, wind, and dust. The tarsal form is characterised by irregularly sized hypertrophic papillae, leading to a cobblestone appearance of the upper tarsal plate. The limbal form is characterised by transient, multiple limbal, or conjunctival gelatinous yellow-grey infiltrates superposed with white points or deposits, known as Horner–Trantas dots and papillae at the limbus."
