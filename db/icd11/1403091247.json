Localized displacement in the axial (horizontal) plane can be focal, signifying less than 25% of the disk circumference, or broad based, meaning between 25% and 50% of the disk circumference. Presence of disk tissue circumferentially (50%–100%) beyond the edges of the ring apophyses may be called bulging and is not considered a form of herniation."
