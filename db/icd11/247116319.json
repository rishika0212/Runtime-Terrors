    "@value": "Disorders due to use of non-psychoactive substances are characterised by the pattern and consequences of non-medical use of non-psychoactive substances. Non-psychoactive substances include laxatives, anabolic steroids, growth hormone, erythropoietin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They may also include proprietary or over-the-counter medicines and folk remedies. Non-medical use of these substances may be associated with harm to the individual due to the direct or secondary toxic effects of the non-psychoactive substance on body organs and systems, or a harmful route of administration (e.g., infections due to intravenous self-administration). They are not associated with intoxication or with a dependence or withdrawal syndrome and are not recognized causes of substance-induced mental disorders."
