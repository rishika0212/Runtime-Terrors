    "@value": "This category should be applied to forms of Stereotyped movement disorder in which stereotyped behaviours result in self-inflicted bodily injury that is significant enough to require medical treatment, or would result in such injury if protective measures (e.g., helmet to prevent head injury) were not employed. Stereotyped movement disorder with self-injury is characterised by voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless (and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early developmental period, are not caused by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication (including withdrawal). Stereotyped movements that are self-injurious can include head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting of the hands, lips, or other body parts."
