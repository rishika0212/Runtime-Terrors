    "@value": "A disease caused by an infection with the parasitic worm Hymenolepis. This disease is commonly asymptomatic. This disease may present with nausea, weakness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or vomiting. Transmission is by the ingestion of eggs commonly in contaminated food or water, or ingestion of infected arthropods. Confirmation is by identification of Hymenolepis eggs in a faecal sample."

    "@value": "Hymenolepiasis is a cosmopolitan parasitosis caused by the dwarf tapeworm Hymenolepis. The prevalence is unknown but the disease occurs mainly in warm regions. Infection occurs through ingestion of uncooked food contaminated with faeces (containing the parasite eggs) from an affected individual or through accidental consummation of insects that have ingested Hymenolepis eggs, in which the parasite develops up until the larval stage. The vast majority of infections produce no symptoms. Among children with clinical infection, symptoms (in order of decreasing frequency) include restlessness, irritability, diarrhea, abdominal pain, restless sleep, anal pruritus, and nasal pruritus. Rare symptoms include anorexia, increased appetite, vomiting, nausea, bloody diarrhea, hives, extremity pain, headache, dizziness, behavioral disturbances, and seizures.Traditional tapeworm treatments (niclosamide and praziquantel) are effective against this parasitosis. Prophylactic treatment revolves around improving hand hygiene and preventing faecal contamination."
