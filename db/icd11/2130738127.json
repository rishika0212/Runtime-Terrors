Primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a very rare disease, and its manifestation can be mimicked by many other diseases. Patients with primary angiitis commonly show headache, waxing and waning altered mental status, and transient ischemic attack-like events. Diagnosis is often based on angiography, although brain biopsy remains the only definitive diagnostic test."
