    "@value": "A syndrome characterised by a persistent personality disturbance that represents a change from the individualâ€™s previous characteristic personality pattern that is judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under Mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., social withdrawal, avoidance, or dependence in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the personality symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention."
