    "@value": "This is a fulminating disease of neonates in which there is extensive mucosal ulceration, pseudomembrane formation, submucosal haemorrhage, and necrosis usually of the right colon, caecum, terminal ileum, and appendix (ENTEROCOLITIS), possibly due to perinatal intestinal ischemia and bacterial invasion. The entire colon, small intestine, stomach, and oesophagus may also be affected. Most infants are premature or suffer from respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or hypoxia. Symptoms (apparent during the first few weeks of life) include abdominal distension, bilious vomiting, and melaena; there may be apnoea, lethargy, temperature instability, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and a fall in blood pressure. The disorder may progress to perforation and peritonitis."
