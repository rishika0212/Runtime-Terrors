    "@value": "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) occurs in monozygotic twins while they are in the uterus. It occurs when blood travels from one twin to the other, and the twin that loses blood is the donor twin, while the twin that receives blood is the recipient twin. Depending on the severity of the transfusion, both infants may experience problems, such as anaemia, paleness, and dehydration in the donor twin, and redness and an increased blood pressure in the recipient twin."
