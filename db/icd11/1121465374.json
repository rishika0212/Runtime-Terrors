    "@value": "Body focused repetitive behaviour disorders are characterised by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g. hair-pulling, skin-picking, lip-biting), typically accompanied by unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour involved, and which lead to dermatological sequelae (e.g., hair loss, skin lesions, lip abrasions). The behaviour may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods. The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning."
