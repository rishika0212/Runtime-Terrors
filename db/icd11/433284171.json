    "@value": "The pathological condition of chronic rhinitis is a continuation of persistent inflammation on nasal turbinate mucosae, which is induced by microbial infection, irritation with inhaled substances and abnormal structure of nasal cavity. This condition induces nasal obstruction and increased nasal discharge. Pharyngitis is an inflammation of whole pharyngeal mucosa and lymphatic tissues and its acute symptoms are a part of the common cold symptoms. Although viral infection is the primary cause, it is also caused by bacterial infections. The discomfort of throat, throat pain and swallowing pain occur. Headache, general fatigueness, radiating pain to the ear and a cervical lymphadenitis also occur. Local finding demonstrates hyperaemic palatine tonsils and swelling of lymphoid follicles of posterior wall of pharynx. Chronic pharyngitis can be considered as a consequence of acute pharyngitis or effect of continuous stimuli, with symptoms of abnormal sensation of throat, discomfort, and foreign body sensation."
