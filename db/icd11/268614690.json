    "@value": "MDMA or related drug-induced mood disorder, including MDA is characterised by mood symptoms (e.g., depressed or elevated mood, decreased engagement in pleasurable activities, increased or decreased energy levels) that develop during or soon after intoxication with MDMA or related drugs. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of mood disturbances that are characteristic of MDMA or related drug intoxication, including MDA. The amount and duration of MDMA or related drug use must be capable of producing mood symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., a Depressive disorder, a Bipolar disorder, Schizoaffective disorder), as might be the case if the mood symptoms preceded the onset of the MDMA or related drug use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the MDMA or related drug use, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with MDMA or related drug use)."
