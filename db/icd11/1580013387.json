    "@value": "Frotteuristic disorder is characterised by a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal—as manifested by persistent sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours—that involves touching or rubbing against a non-consenting person in crowded public places. In addition, in order for Frotteuristic Disorder to be diagnosed, the individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or be markedly distressed by them. Frotteuristic Disorder specifically excludes consensual touching or rubbing that occurs with the consent of the person or persons involved."
