This disease is characterised by elevated levels of methemoglobin within the blood leading to haemoglobin ineffectively releasing oxygen to body tissues. This disease may present with shortness of breath, cyanosis, headache, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness and loss of consciousness. Confirmation is by identification of mutation by genetic testing."
