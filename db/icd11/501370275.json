This disease is characterised by headache, fever, seizures, or neurological deficits. Transmission is through hematogenous spread of larvae to the meninges after ingestion of Taenia solium eggs (or proglottids) in contaminated food or water. Confirmation is by advanced imaging and detection of antibodies against Taenia solium from serum or cerebrospinal fluid."
