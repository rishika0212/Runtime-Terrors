    "@value": "All definitional requirements of bodily distress disorder are present. There is excessive attention to distressing symptoms and their consequences, which may result in frequent medical visits, but the person is not preoccupied with the symptoms (e.g., the individual spends less than an hour per day focusing on them). Although the individual expresses distress about the symptoms and they may have some impact on his or her life (e.g., strain in relationships, less effective academic or occupational functioning, abandonment of specific leisure activities), there is no substantial impairment in the personâ€™s personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
