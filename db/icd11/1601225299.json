    "@value": "The investigation employed relevant empirical testing of the device of another lot or batch than that of the suspected device in the reported adverse event in order to support the identification of possible causes for the adverse event. This includes devices without a lot/batch designation. Testing was performed using the device retained by the manufacturer (i.e. was not shipped). Relevant testing would typically be based on test methods used for evaluating safety and performance as described in the latest relevant standards."
