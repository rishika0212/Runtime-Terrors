    "@value": "A disease of the hepatic system, caused by an infection with the parasitic worm Fasciola. In the acute phase, this disease is characterised by upper abdominal pain, fever, urticaria, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting due to migration of the parasite from the intestines to the liver. In the chronic phase, this disease is characterised by cholestasis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, or gallstones. This disease may be asymptomatic. Transmission is by ingestion of undercooked contaminated aquatic plants or contaminated water. Confirmation is commonly by identification of Fasciola eggs in a faecal sample (after the individual has followed a liver-free diet prior to testing), or detection of antibodies against Fasciola."
