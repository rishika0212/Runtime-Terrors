    "@value": "Cannabis dependence is a disorder of regulation of cannabis use arising from repeated or continuous use of cannabis. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use cannabis, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use cannabis. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of cannabis, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of cannabis, or repeated use of cannabis or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if cannabis use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months."
