Individuals notice a blackish discolouration on the ventral or lateral areas of the tongue. The incidence increases with age with no gender predilection. The diagnosis is often based on clinical appearance. No treatment is required for this condition; however, haemorrhagic telangiectasia should be excluded in these individuals."
