    "@value": "Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy is characterised by repetitive myoclonic jerks that occur during sleep in neonates and infants. Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy is commonly confused with epilepsy. However, unlike the jerks of myoclonic seizures and myoclonic encephalopathy, the jerks of Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy occur exclusively during sleep. The jerks are often bilateral and massive, typically involving large muscle groups."
