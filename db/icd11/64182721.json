    "@value": "A condition caused by failure of the larynx to correctly develop during the antenatal period. This disease is characterised by collapse of the supraglottic structures into the airway during the inspiratory phase of respiration, resulting in inspiratory stridor. This disease may also present with regurgitation, emesis, cough, choking, slow feedings, weight loss, failure to thrive, tachypnoea, suprasternal and substernal retractions, cyanosis, pectus excavatum, or obstructive sleep apnoea. Confirmation is through verification of supraglottic collapse by flexible laryngoscopy."
