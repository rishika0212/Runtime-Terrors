    "@value": "A congenital cardiovascular malformation in which the right ventricle is divided into two chambers, one inferior including the inlet and trabecular portions of the right ventricle and one superior including the trabecular portion and infundibulum. \n\nAdditional information: Double chamber right ventricle is often associated with one or several closing ventricular septal defects. In some cases, the ventricular septal defect is already closed. Double chamber right ventricle is differentiated from the rare isolated infundibular stenosis that develops more superiorly."
