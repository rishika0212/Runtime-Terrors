    "@value": "Bipolar type II disorder, current episode depressive, mild is diagnosed when the definitional requirements for Bipolar type II disorder have been met and the current episode is depressive at a mild level of severity. A depressive episode is characterised by a period of depressed mood or diminished interest in activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue. In a mild depressive episode, the individual is usually distressed by the symptoms and has some difficulty in continuing to function in one or more domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important domains). There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode."
