    "@value": "This is a severe gangrenous disease of the oral and facial tissues, occurring essentially in children recovering from infectious diseases, but it has also been reported in debitilated adults, such as concentration camp inmates. An early symptom is a small vesicle or ulcer on the buccal or gingival mucosa, which rapidly becomes necrotic and spreads to the surrounding tissues of the jaws, lips, and cheeks, presenting fetid, dark, gangrenous mass surrounded by indurated tissue with a waxlike shine; the tongue and palate sometimes may be involved. Pain, fever, and general malaise are associated. Complications may include toxemia and pneumonia. Borrelia vincentii and immune mechanisms have been suggested as possible, causative agents."
