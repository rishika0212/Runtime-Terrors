    "@value": "A precipitate delivery is one that is < 3 hours and where contractions are unusually severe. It commonly occurs in multiparous women or when labour has been induced. Due to the force and speed of delivery, trauma may occur to the mother and newborn. The mother may suffer from haemorrhage, perineal laceration, infection, or uterine rupture, and the newborn may suffer from subdural hematoma, anoxia, or fractures."
