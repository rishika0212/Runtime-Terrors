    "@value": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs when lymphoid cells from an immunocompetent donor are introduced into a histo-incompatible recipient incapable of rejecting them. This usually occurs as a result of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The main targets attacked by the donor lymphocytes are the recipientâ€™s skin, gastrointestinal tract and liver. Acute GVHD, normally occurring within the first 100 days following transplantation, has a high mortality. The acute phase may be followed by chronic GVHD, which can also arise de novo. This usually presents as a lichenoid rash but can develop into a severe fibrosing disease affecting skin, lungs and liver."
