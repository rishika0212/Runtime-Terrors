    "@value": "Vasculitis in arteries or veins of any size in a single organ that has no features that indicate that it is a limited expression of a systemic vasculitis. The involved organ and vessel type should be included in the name (e.g. cutaneous SVV, testicular arteritis, central nervous system vasculitis). Vasculitis distribution may be unifocal or multifocal (diffuse) within an organ. Some patients originally diagnosed with SOV will develop additional disease manifestations that warrant re-defining the case as one of the systemic vasculitides (e.g. cutaneous arteritis later becoming systemic polyarteritis nodosa, etc.).
