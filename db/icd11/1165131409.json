    "@value": "In immunodeficient patients, toxoplasmosis most often occurs in persons with defects in T cell–mediated immunity such as those receiving corticosteroids, anti–tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, or cytotoxic drugs and those with hematologic malignancies, organ transplants, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\nPulmonary toxoplasmosis in the immunodeficient patient may appear in the form of interstitial pneumonitis, necrotizing pneumonitis, consolidation, pleural effusion, or empyema, or all of these.\n\nAIDS patients with Toxoplasma pneumonia present with cough, dyspnoea, and fever. As toxoplasmosis is generally seen only in advanced HIV infection with CD4 counts below 100, the majority of AIDS patients who develop toxoplasma pneumonia already have had previous HIV-associated opportunistic infections. In solid organ transplant patients, this is most commonly due to transplantation of a toxoplasma-seropositive lung or heart into a seronegative recipient, resulting in primary pulmonary disease. In bone marrow transplant patients, pulmonary toxoplasmosis occurs in 0.28% to 0.45% of patients. Unlike solid organ transplant patients, most of these patients have reactivation, not primary disease."
