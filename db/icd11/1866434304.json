Prolongation is defined as either intubation using special techniques (fibreoptic intubation) or three or more attempts at intubation using direct laryngoscopy or videolaryngoscopy when performed by a fully trained and expert anesthetist. Failure is defined as the abandonment of the attempt at intubation."
