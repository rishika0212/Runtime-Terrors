This disease is characterised by symptoms of measles as well as inflammation of the meninges. This disease may also present with a fever, vomiting, lethargy, confusion, muscle pain, photophobia, or convulsions. Transmission is by haematogenous spread to the meninges after inhalation of infected respiratory secretions, airborne transmission, or direct contact. Confirmation is by detection of Morbillivirus RNA or measles-specific IgM antibodies."
