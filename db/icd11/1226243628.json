    "@value": "Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic-induced delirium is characterised by an acute state of disturbed attention and awareness with specific features of delirium that develops during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or during the use of sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics. Specific features of Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic-induced delirium may include confusion and disorientation, paranoid delusions, and recurrent visual, tactile or auditory hallucinations. The amount and duration of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use must be capable of producing delirium. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder, by use of or withdrawal from a different substance, or by another health condition that is not classified under Mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders."
