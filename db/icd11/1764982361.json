    "@value": "A provisional diagnosis for a skin eruption of unknown or uncertain nature which arises abruptly and consists of multiple excoriations. In the majority of cases the excoriation is secondary to intense pruritus arising either from an underlying systemic disorder such as cholestatic jaundice or from a pruritic skin disease such as eczema. In some cases, however, psychogenic factors may be responsible."
