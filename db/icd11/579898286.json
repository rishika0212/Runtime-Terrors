    "@value": "A clinical syndrome of chronic vertigo, dizziness, or unsteadiness lasting months to years and generally including features suggestive of persistent vestibular system dysfunction (e.g., oscillopsia, nystagmus, gait unsteadiness). There may also be symptoms or signs suggesting cochlear or central nervous system dysfunction. Chronic vestibular syndrome often connotes a progressive, deteriorating course, but sometimes instead reflects a stable, incomplete recovery after an acute vestibular event, or persistent, lingering symptoms between episodic vestibular events."

There may also be symptoms or signs suggesting cochlear or central nervous system dysfunction. Chronic vestibular syndrome often connotes a progressive, deteriorating course, but sometimes instead reflects a stable, incomplete recovery after an acute vestibular event, or persistent, lingering symptoms between episodic vestibular events. Disorders typically presenting this syndrome include poorly-compensated unilateral vestibulopathy, chronic bilateral vestibulopathy, cerebellar degeneration, posterior cranial fossa neoplasms, and chronic psychological or behavioral conditions manifesting prominent vestibular symptoms."
