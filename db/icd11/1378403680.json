    "@value": "Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, jet lag type is characterised by a temporary mismatch between the timing of the sleep and wake cycle generated by the endogenous circadian clock and that of the sleep and wake pattern required by transmeridian travel across at least two time zones. Individuals complain of disturbed sleep, sleepiness and fatigue, somatic symptoms (e.g. gastrointestinal distress) or impaired daytime function. The severity and duration of symptoms is dependent on the number of time zones traveled, the ability to sleep while traveling, exposure to appropriate circadian times cues in the new environment, tolerance to circadian misalignment when awake during the biological night, and the direction of the travel. The symptoms result in significant distress or mental, physical, social, occupational or academic impairment."
