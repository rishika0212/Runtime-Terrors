    "@value": "Frostbite is injury from ice formation within tissues resulting from contact with cold air, liquids or metals. It is most commonly due to excessive exposure of skin to sub-zero environmental temperatures. The risk of injury is exacerbated by wind. The most commonly affected sites are fingers, toes, ears, nose, cheeks and chin with injury limited to skin and soft tissues. Full thickness skin necrosis and injury to deeper structures including muscles and bone may occur with prolonged exposure to cold."
