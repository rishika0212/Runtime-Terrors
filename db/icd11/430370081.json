    "@value": "Myoglobinuria is the presence of myoglobin in the urine usually as result of rhabdomyolysis. Any process that interferes with the storage or use of energy by muscle cells can lead to myoglobinuria. When excreted into the urine, myoglobin can precipitate, causing tubular obstruction and acute kidney injury. The most common causes of myoglobinuria in adults are trauma, alcohol and drug abuse, usually in relation to muscle necrosis from prolonged immobilization and pressure by the body weight. Prolonged ethanol consumption and seizure activity, similar to excessive physical activity, can produce an imbalance between muscle energy consumption and production, resulting in muscle destruction."
