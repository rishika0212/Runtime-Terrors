    "@value": "Defective function of the cilia lining the respiratory tract (lower and upper, sinuses, Eustachian tube, middle ear) resulting in altered mucociliary transport and manifesting as recurrent upper and lower respiratory infection, chronic productive cough, chronic rhinosinusitis or persistent otitis media. Acquired forms result from respiratory tract injury associated especially with respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The rare primary forms are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders presenting early in life and typically progressing to bronchiectasis; they may be associated with infertility in men and women due to abnormal sperm motility or fallopian tube function respectively."
