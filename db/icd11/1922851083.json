    "@value": "Dementia due to injury to the head is caused by damage inflicted on the tissues of the brain as the direct or indirect result of an external force. Trauma to the brain is known to have resulted in loss of consciousness, amnesia, disorientation and confusion, or neurological signs. The symptoms characteristic of Dementia due to injury to the head must arise immediately following the trauma or after the individual gains consciousness and must persist beyond the acute post-injury period. Cognitive deficits vary depending on the specific brain areas affected and the severity of the injury but can include impairments in attention, memory, executive functioning, personality, processing speed, social cognition, and language abilities."
