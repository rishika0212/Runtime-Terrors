    "@value": "This primary immunodeficiency syndrome is characterised by a specific natural-killer (NK) cell deficiency and susceptibility to viral diseases. It has been described in four children from a large inbred kindred. Three out of the four children reported developed a viral illness. The mode of transmission is most likely autosomal recessive. The causative gene has been localised to within a 12-Mb region on chromosome 8p11.23-q11.21."
