    "@value": "Neonatal cerebral leukomalacia is a neonatal form of white-matter brain injury, causing cystic lesions and gliosis in the white matter around the ventricles characterized by the necrosis of white matter near the lateral ventricles. Neonatal cerebral leukomalacia is much more common in premature infants than in full-term infants. A major cause is thought to be changes in blood flow to the area around the ventricles of the brain. This area is fragile and prone to injury, especially before 32 weeks of gestation."
