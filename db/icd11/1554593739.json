This syndrome is characterised by fever, blisters, erythema, large areas of skin peel, or Nikolskyâ€™s sign. Transmission is by direct or indirect contact with an infected individual, through fomites, or by iatrogenic transmission. Confirmation is by identification of Staphylococcus in a blood or skin sample."

    "@value": "A toxin-mediated staphylococcal skin disorder which occurs most commonly in neonates and infants but may be seen at any age. The epidermolytic toxin is produced by specific phage types of Staphylococcus aureus and is disseminated via the bloodstream. It causes superficial epidermal detachment at the level of the stratum granulosum. Clinically it presents with a diffuse erythema which progresses to blistering and shedding of large sheets of superficial epidermis."
