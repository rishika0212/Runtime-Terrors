    "@value": "Type 2 narcolepsy is a disorder of excessive sleepiness characterised by daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep and abnormal manifestations of REM sleep as demonstrated by multiple sleep latency test (MSLT/PSG) findings in the context of normal hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin) signaling. That is, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin determinations are > 110 picograms per milliliter. Cataplexy is not present. The disorder is not attributable to a disease of the nervous system or other medical condition.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep and multiple sleep latency test/polysomnography (MSLT/PSG) findings characteristic of narcolepsy. There should be no evidence of cataplexy or CSF hypocretin deficiency (if testing is performed)."
