    "@value": "A disease caused by an infection with monkeypox virus. In the first phase, this disease is characterised by lymphadenopathy, fever, headache, or malaise; in the second phase, this disease is characterised by a rash that starts as maculopapules and progresses to vesicles, then pustules, followed by crusts (may occur on the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, body, and mucous membranes). Transmission is by direct contact with infected animals (including body fluids or lesions), direct contact with body fluid from infected individuals, or through fomites. Confirmation is by identification of monkeypox virus."
