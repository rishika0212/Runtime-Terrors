    "@value": "A disease of the joints, caused by an infection with a bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic source.\n\nDistinction is made between the following types of etiological relationship.\na) direct infection of joint, where organisms invade synovial tissue and microbial antigen is present in the joint;\nb) indirect infection, which may be of two types: a reactive arthropathy, where microbial infection of the body is established but neither organisms nor antigens can be identified in the joint, and a postinfective arthropathy, where microbial antigen is present but recovery of an organism is inconstant and evidence of local multiplication is lacking."
