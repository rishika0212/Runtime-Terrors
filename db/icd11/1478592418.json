Much less often, however, it is due to other causes - e.g., malabsorption or dietary intolerance, endocrine abnormalities, hormone-secreting tumours, pancreatic and liver dysfunction. Non-infectious causes of diarrhoea may have other systemic signs and symptoms. Neonates are at particular risk of dehydration and malnutrition."
