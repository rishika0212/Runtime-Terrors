    "@value": "Keloid and hypertrophic scars result from the production of excessive amounts of collagen in the dermis during connective tissue repair following inflammation, injury or surgery. Keloid scars often develop apparently spontaneously after minor injury or inflammation and expand beyond the boundary of that initial injury or inflammation. Hypertrophic scars on the other hand remain confined to the area of injury or inflammation and may undergo spontaneous resolution."
