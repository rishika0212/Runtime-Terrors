    "@value": "A congenital cardiovascular malformation of the aortic valve in which there is narrowing or stricture (obstruction to flow).\n\nAdditional information: 'Congenital aortic valvar stenosis' arises most commonly as a result of partial or complete fusion of one or more commissures, or is due to dysplasia of one or more aortic cusps. These congenital malformations of the aortic valve may not be initially obstructive but may become stenotic later in life due to leaflet thickening, poor relative growth and-or calcification. It is not until the congenitally malformed aortic valve is or becomes stenotic that this term should be used."
