    "@value": "Cellulite is a common architectural derangement of subcutaneous adipose tissue which results in dimpling and nodularity of the overlying skin. It is seen most commonly in postpubertal women and affects principally the pelvic region, lower limbs, and abdomen. It is thought to result from herniation of multiple small aggregates of subcutaneous fat through the fibrous tissue at the dermohypodermal junction. Obesity predisposes to but is not necessary for its development. The term is in widespread use but is misleading as it has nothing to do with cellulitis. The condition is asymptomatic but may cause considerable embarrassment."
