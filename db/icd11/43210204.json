    "@value": "Lichen sclerosus of the penis develops almost exclusively in uncircumcised males and is the result of chronic occluded contact of susceptible epithelium to urine. It often causes dyspareunia and difficulties with micturition. It manifests typically as a sclerotic phimosis of the prepuce, which it may not be possible to retract, together with inflammation and sclerosis of the mucocutaneous surface of the prepuce and glans penis. Stenosis and occasionally obliteration of the external meatal orifice may occur in severe cases. Although most commonly recognised in adult men it is a common cause of acquired phimosis in boys."
