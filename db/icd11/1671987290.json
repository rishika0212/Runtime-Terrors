They occur when the intake of essential macronutrients and micronutrients does not meet or exceeds the metabolic demands for those nutrients. Metabolic demands vary with age and other physiological conditions, they are also affected by environmental circumstances, including poor hygiene and sanitation, which lead to diarrhea and other infections."
