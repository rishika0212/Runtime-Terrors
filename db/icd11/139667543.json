    "@value": "Primary central sleep apnoea of infancy is characterised by prolonged (> 20 seconds), predominantly central apnoeas or periodic breathing during more than 5% of total sleep time in an infant of at least 37 weeks conceptional age. These events are typically associated with physiological compromise (hypoxemia, bradycardia), or the need for intervention such as stimulation or resuscitation. This diagnosis should be assigned when central events are the predominant finding, even if obstructive or mixed apnoeas or hypopneas are also present.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography or alternative monitoring such as hospital or home monitoring."
