    "@value": "Acute haemorrhagic oedema is an immune complex-mediated cutaneous vasculitis usually associated with respiratory infection or immunization. It affects children between the ages of 4 months and 2 years, with males being affected twice as frequently as females. The dramatic clinical appearance of facial and limb oedema with multiple targetoid purpuric macules belies its generally benign course."
