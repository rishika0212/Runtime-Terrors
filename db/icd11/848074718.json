    "@value": "An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a pregnancy begins outside of the uterus. The most common site is within one of the fallopian tubes, although in rare cases, ectopic pregnancies can occur in the stomach region, cervix, or ovary. It is often caused by a condition that slows or blocks the movement of a fertilised egg through the fallopian tube to the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies cannot continue to term and the developing cells must be removed to prevent rupture of the ectopic area, which can lead to shock and danger the life of the mother."
