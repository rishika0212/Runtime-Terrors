    "@value": "Hazardous gaming refers to a pattern of gaming, either online or offline, that appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences to the individual or to others around the individual. The increased risk may be from the frequency of gaming, the amount of time spent on these activities, the neglect of other activities and priorities, risky behaviours associated with gaming or its context, the adverse consequences of gaming, or from the combination of these factors. The pattern of gaming often persists in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the individual or to others. This category may be used when the pattern of gaming behaviour warrants attention and advice from health professionals but does not meet the diagnostic requirements for Gaming Disorder."
