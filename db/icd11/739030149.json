    "@value": "Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy, showing progressive, symmetrical muscle weakness, low muscle endurance, and cutaneous manifestations such as Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash, shawl sign, V-sign and mechanic’s hand. Internal organ manifestations such as interstitial pneumonia (pneumonitis) and myocarditis sometimes develop. The skin rash may precede the muscle symptoms and may be the only clinical sign of dermatomyositis in some patients (clinically, amyopathic dermatomyositis)."
