    "@value": "A non-IgE-mediated intestinal hypersensitivity (in the absence of IgE antibodies) induced by food protein that induces inflammatory response mainly to the rectum and distal sigmoid colon. This is a condition in infants that results from an immune response triggered by proteins in the diet mainly milk (through breast-feeding). Patients usually appear healthy and have normal, soft stools that contain flecks or streaks of blood. The diagnosis is usually made based upon the resolution of symptoms upon withdrawal of the presumed food antigen. The usual onset is in the first 2 months of life but it also occurs in infants from 1 day to 6 months of age."
