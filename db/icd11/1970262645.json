By definition, there is involvement of at least one mucous membrane and skin detachment is limited to less than 10% of body surface area. Most cases occur within the first 8 weeks of drug exposure. The drugs most commonly involved are antimicrobial sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, allopurinol, nevirapine and oxicamâ€“nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."
