    "@value": "A congenital cardiovascular malformation associated with narrowing within the outflow tract supporting the pulmonary valve. \n\nAdditional information: subvalvar (infundibular) pulmonary stenosis is a narrowing of the outflow tract of the ventricle immediately below the pulmonic valve. This term should preferably be used in the setting of abnormal ventriculo-arterial connections, such as double outlet ventricle. Although subvalvar pulmonary stenosis is a type of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction if the ventriculo-arterial connections are normal, in this setting 'Congenital right ventricular outflow tract obstruction' should be used. Subvalvar pulmonary stenosis is also a type of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in the setting of discordant ventriculo-arterial connections; this term should be used when the obstruction is only apparent immediately below the pulmonary valve, otherwise the term 'Congenital left ventricular outflow tract obstruction' should be used"
