The co-occurring Disorder of intellectual development should be classified separately, using the appropriate category to designate severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, profound, provisional). Because autism spectrum disorder inherently involves social deficits, assessment of a co-occurring Disorder of intellectual development should place greater emphasis on intellectual, conceptual, and practical domains than on social adaptation."
