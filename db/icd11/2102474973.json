    "@value": "A provisional diagnosis for a chronic skin disorder of unknown or uncertain nature characterised by the presence of multiple excoriations. In some cases the excoriation is secondary to intense pruritus arising either from an underlying systemic disorder such as uraemia or from a pruritic skin disease such as eczema. In many cases, however, psychogenic factors may be responsible."
