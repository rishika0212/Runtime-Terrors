    "@value": "This syndrome is characterized by the association of sensorineural hearing impairment and peripheral neuropathy. It has been described in members from four generations of a Spanish family. The hearing impairment was mild and often asymmetrical. The neuropathy was demyelinating with predominantly sensory involvement but severity was variable ranging from asymptomatic individuals to patients with skin ulcers and osteomyelitis requiring amputation. The syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner and is caused by mutations in the GJB3 gene (1p34)."
