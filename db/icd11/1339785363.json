    "@value": "Neuropathic pain is described as electric, burning, or shock like, caused by metabolic, nutritional, infectious, genetic, autoimmune, and/or vasculitic processes. The pain may occur spontaneously, without provocation, or be provoked by noxious or nonnoxious stimuli. Pain is characteristic of small fibre neuropathy, but even in large fibre neuropathies, a sufficient number of small fibres may be damaged to cause pain. Neuropathic pain usually affects distal skin and subcutaneous structures. The pain may be constant or intermittent, and may be described as searing, burning, or icy cold. \n\nComplex regional pain syndrome follows trauma and comprises regional pain, sensory changes, abnormalities of temperature, sudomotor activity, colour changes of the skin, and oedema."
