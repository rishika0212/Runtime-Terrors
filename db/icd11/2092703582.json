    "@value": "Although all infectious agents in humans are parasites, by convention, parasitic diseases are defined as those caused by protozoa or helminths. The pathophysiology of the diseases caused by these organisms is determined by their life cycle. Mechanisms of diarrhoea production by intestinal protozoa are related to direct cytotoxic effects, the ability to invade, and/or effects of the immune response on the intestinal epithelium. No evidence suggests that intestinal protozoa produce enterotoxins."
