    "@value": "A syndrome characterised by the presence of prominent dissociative symptoms (e.g., depersonalization, derealization) that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., as part of an acute stress reaction in response to a life-threatening diagnosis). This category should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the dissociative symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention."
