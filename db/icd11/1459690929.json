    "@value": "Neutrophil immunodeficiency syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by neutrophilia with severe neutrophil dysfunction, leukocytosis, a predisposition to bacterial infections and poor wound healing, including an absence of pus in infected areas. Prevalence is unknown but, to date, two cases have been reported. The disease is due to a point dominant negative mutation in the RAC2 gene causing decreased Rac2 protein expression and a defect in a signaling pathway controlling shape change/motility of neutrophils as well as assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase. The mode of transmission is unknown. Neutrophil immunodeficiency syndrome presents as similar to leukocyte-adhesion deficiency (LAD; see this term), however there is no evidence of deficiency in the CD11b/CD18 complex."
