    "@value": "Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected by dengue viruses. It is one disease entity with different clinical presentations and often with unpredictable clinical evolution and outcome. Most patients recover following a self-limiting non-severe clinical course like nausea, vomiting, rash, aches and pains, but a small proportion progress to severe disease, mostly characterised by plasma leakage with or without haemorrhage, although severe haemorrhages or severe organ impairment can occur, with or without dengue shock."
