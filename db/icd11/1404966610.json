    "@value": "The most frequent and important hepatic neoplasm is the primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In many parts of the world, in particular Africa and Asia, it poses a significant disease burden. In these high incidence regions, chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the principal underlying cause, with the exception of Japan which has a high prevalence of hepatitis C infection. HBV vaccination has become a powerful tool in reducing cirrhosis and HCC, but implementation is still suboptimal in several high risk regions. In Western countries, chronic alcohol abuse is a major aetiological factor. Hepatic cholangiocarcinoma has a different geographical distribution, with peak incidences in Northern Thailand. Here, it is caused by chronic infection with the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, which is ingested through infected raw fish."
