    "@value": "Overweight is a condition characterized by excessive adiposity. Overweight is assessed by the body mass index (BMI), which is a surrogate marker of adiposity calculated as weight (kg)/height² (m²). The BMI categories for defining overweight vary by age and gender in infants, children and adolescents. For adults, overweight (or pre-obesity) is defined by a BMI ranging from 25.00 to 29.99 kg/m². Localized adiposity is a condition characterized by accumulation of adipose tissue in specific regions of the body independently of BMI."
