    "@value": "All definitional requirements of bodily distress disorder are present. There is persistent preoccupation with the distressing symptoms and their consequences (e.g., the individual spends more than an hour a day thinking about them), typically associated with frequent medical visits. The person devotes much of his or her energy to focusing on the symptoms and their consequences. The symptoms and associated distress and preoccupation cause moderate impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (e.g., relationship conflict, performance problems at work, abandonment of a range of social and leisure activities)."
