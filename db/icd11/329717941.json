Harm to health of the individual occurs due to one or more of the following: (1) behaviour related to intoxication; (2) direct or secondary toxic effects on body organs and systems; or (3) a harmful route of administration. Harm to health of others includes any form of physical harm, including trauma, or mental disorder that is directly attributable to behaviour related to synthetic cannabinoid intoxication on the part of the person to whom the diagnosis of Harmful pattern of use of synthetic cannabinoids applies."
