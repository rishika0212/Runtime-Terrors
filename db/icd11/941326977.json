Airflow and respiratory effort cease simultaneously in a repetitive fashion over the course of the night. The recurrent episodes of apnoea (more than five per hour) and associated arousals are sufficiently severe to cause symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, disturbed sleep, awakening with dyspnoea, or snoring.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."
