    "@value": "This form of histoplasmosis is endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa and is generally less virulent than histoplasmosis due to H. capsulatum, the classical form which occurs predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas but is also seen in Africa and Asia. Otherwise known as African histoplasmosis, histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma duboisii usually involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue, lymph nodes and bones and rarely the lungs and other internal organs."
