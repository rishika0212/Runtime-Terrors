    "@value": "Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (hypersensitivity vasculitis; hypersensitivity angiitis) is a histopathological term commonly used to denote a small-vessel vasculitis. It may be localised to the skin or may manifest in other organs. The internal organs affected most commonly include the joints, the gastrointestinal tract, and the kidneys. The prognosis is good in the absence of internal involvement. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis has many causes including infections, drugs and systemic autoimmune diseases but no cause is identified in up to 50% of patients with this condition."
