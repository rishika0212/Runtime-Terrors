    "@value": "A common low grade inflammatory dermatosis of unknown aetiology in which multiple small finely scaling macules appear on the face, and less commonly the shoulders and upper arms, of children. These may initially be mildly erythematous but soon become hypopigmented with fine surface scale. Histopathologically there is a mild subacute spongiotic dermatitis with reduction in melanin. It is more prominent in children with pigmented skin and may give rise to concern about vitiligo."
