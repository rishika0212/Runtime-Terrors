    "@value": "The main adverse effect of increased sodium chloride in the diet is increased blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular-renal diseases. However, evidence from a variety of studies, including observational studies and clinical trials, has demonstrated heterogeneity in the blood pressure responses to sodium intake. Those individuals with the greatest reductions in blood pressure in response to decreased sodium intake are termed “salt sensitive”."
