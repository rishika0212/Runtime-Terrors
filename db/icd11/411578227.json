The typical causative factor will be caries or trauma to a tooth or teeth or associated tissues. In addition to clinical examination, imaging (intraoral x-rays, CT scans etc.) may facilitate the correct diagnosis. If the etiology is vague, consider using codes in the section of chronic primary pain.\n\nFor most purposes, patients receive a diagnosis according to the underlying causes, and some secondary headache and orofacial pain disorders present with typical headache and orofacial pain phenotypes. It can be difficult to separate between primary and secondary headache in some cases (e.g., chronic primary orofacial pain, persistent idiopathic dentoalveolar pain). For chronic secondary orofacial pain conditions, some of the disorders may be listed under musculoskeletal diseases or diseases of the digestive system\n\nEach distinct type, subtype, or subform of headache or orofacial pain that the patient has must be separately diagnosed and coded. When a patient receives more than one diagnosis, these should be listed in the order of importance to the patient.\n\nDiagnostic Criteria:\n\nCriteria A to E are fulfilled:\n\nA. Chronic orofacial pain (persistent or recurrent for longer than 3 months) is present.\n\nB. The pain occurs for 2 hours or more per day on at least 15 days or more per month.\n\nC. There is clinical and/or imaging evidence of a disorder or lesion of one tooth or more teeth and / or associated tissues, known to be able to cause headache / orofacial pain\n\nD. There is evidence of causation demonstrated by at least two of the following:\n\nD1. the orofacial pain has developed in temporal relation to the onset of the disorder or appearance of the lesion\n\nD2. At least one of the following:\n\na) the orofacial pain has signiﬁcantly worsened in parallel with worsening or progression of the disorder or lesion\n\nb) the orofacial pain has signiﬁcantly improved or resolved in parallel with improvement in or resolution of the disorder or lesion\n\nD3. the orofacial pain is exacerbated by palpation, probing or pressure applied to the aﬀected tooth or teeth or associated tissues\n\nD4. in the case of a unilateral disorder or lesion, headache / orofacial pain is localized and ipsilateral to it\n\nE. The pain is not better accounted for by another chronic pain condition."
