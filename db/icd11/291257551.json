    "@value": "Epidural haemorrhage is a blood collection between the skull (calvarial) bone and the inner periosteum or between the periosteal membrane and the underlining outer dura fibrous stratum. It results from mechanical forces exerted on the fetal head. In the neonate the middle meningeal artery is not embedded in the cranial bones and is less susceptible to injury. The incidence of epidural hemorrhage in the newborn is approximately 2% of all cases of intracranial hemorrhage. Epidural hemorrhage is frequently associated with skull fractures or cephalhematoma."
