    "@value": "Insufficient sleep syndrome occurs when an individual persistently fails to obtain the amount of sleep required relative to their own physiological sleep requirements to maintain normal levels of alertness and wakefulness and is thus chronically sleep deprived. The curtailed sleep pattern is present most days for at least several months.\n\nThe personâ€™s ability to initiate and maintain sleep is unimpaired. Sleep time is often markedly extended on weekend nights or during holidays compared to weekday. Extension of total sleep time results in resolution of the symptoms of sleepiness."
