These hematomas may also occur secondary to occipital osteodiastasis. There is often an accompanying skull fracture. The incidence of subdural hemorrhage is 2.9/10,000 live births after spontaneous delivery; 4.1/10,000 after cesarean section without labor; 8.0/10,000 after vacuum delivery; 9.8/10,000 after forceps delivery; 21.3/10,000 after combined vacuum and forceps delivery and 25.7/10,000 after cesarean section following failed instrumental vaginal delivery. The long term outcome depends on the size of the lesion and the presence of intraparenchymal lesions."
