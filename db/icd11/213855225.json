    "@value": "Neonatal lupus erythematosus results from trans-placental transfer of maternal antibodies, in particular anti-Ro/SSA and anti La/SSB. It manifests with an erythematous rash which may be obviously photosensitive and is closely associated with congenital heart block. The mother may have known lupus, especially subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but she may be asymptomatic. The rash normally subsides within the first few months of life."
