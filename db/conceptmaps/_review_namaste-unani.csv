Clinical findings include those found using physical, laboratory and imaging techniques. 

Diseases can manifest in many ways and in different body systems. Such specific manifestations may be a reason for treatment or encounter, with or without identifying or addressing the underlying condition.  
Categories in this chapter include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, could be designated 'not otherwise specified', 'unknown aetiology' or 'transient'.

The conditions and signs or symptoms included in this chapter consist of:

  - cases for which no more specific diagnosis can be made even after all the facts bearing on the case have been investigated
  - signs or symptoms existing at the time of initial encounter that proved to be transient and whose causes could not be determined;
  - provisional diagnoses in a patient who failed to return for further investigation or care;
  - cases referred elsewhere for investigation or treatment before the diagnosis was made;
  - cases in which a more precise diagnosis was not available for any other reason; 
  - certain symptoms, for which supplementary information is provided, that represent important problems in medical care in their own right.

These categories should be used in conjunction with a code from another chapter that identifies the underlying condition.",63.97,ME66,Miscellaneous non-specific skin-related symptoms and signs,63.33,,,,,,,,,,review,63.97,,
